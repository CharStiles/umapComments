# About

This is an interactive visualization that uses the [UMAP algorithm](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) of [ShaderToy](https://shadertoy.com) comments.
Data was extracted from crawling shadertoy.com, using selenium and beautifulsoup.
I used top2vec to vector encodings and then used the UMAP algorithm to visualize the comments in 2D space.
This code is based off of [this notebook and code](https://beta.observablehq.com/@grantcuster/using-three-js-for-2d-data-visualization).


This was made for Ben Fry's [Data Visualization class](https://infodesign.mit.edu/) at MIT Spring 2024.
