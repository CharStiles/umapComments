The distribution is advected using forward advection by integrating how much of the particle distribution falls into this cell. The distribution used here is a square. It can be whatever though, a Gaussian, a circle etc. A square is just the simplest one.\nThe forces are computed similarly to SPH but with some differences in the pressure computation to deal with vacuum virtual particles(remember, every pixel has a particle even if there is nothing there)",

It's not easily (or at all) visible in 2D if the line is thick enough, or depending on the control points, but if it's used in 3D (like with the revolution function), it can create a big nasty, noisy split in the object.\n\nYou can see it here if you set:\n\nvec2 p = (2.0*fragCoord-iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y*0.25 + vec2(4.0, 6.0);\nvec2 m = (2.0*iMouse.xy-iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y*0.25 + vec2(4.0, 6.0);\n\nvec2 v0 = vec2(3.4, 8.75);\nvec2 v1 = vec2(5.9, 0.0);\nvec2 v2 = vec2(0.0, 0.0);\n\nFortunately, there's an easy solution that I came up with.\n\nAfter the vec2 x = (vec2(h,-h)-q)/2.0; line in the 1 root section, simply add this:\n\nif(abs(abs(h/q) - 1.0) < 0.0001)\n{\n    x = vec2(p3/q, -q - p3/q);\n\n    if(q < 0.0)\n        x = x.yx;\n}\n\nIt could definitely be optimised, but it demonstrates the fix.\n\nWhat's happening is that when h and q are nearly equal (which is in areas surrounding p = 0), the floating point error becomes huge, as we need the difference between them, but the precision is lost.\n\nMy solution is to estimate x with a calculation that doesn't suffer from this. The estimate is very good when h and q are close, so it works well, provided the threshold value is reasonable (0.0001 seems to do the job).",

        "ollj, 2019-11-20profhua, there are many {Quadratic Bezier - 2D Distance] shaders on shadertoy, iq just tends to keeps things simple and small, but others are better for illustration or docuentation:\n\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdXBzB\n\nthe main math here involves fiunding an inverse to a quadratic function, and this involves solving for 3 roots of a cubic function. each root translates to one distance to a point on the curve/spline, and we only care for the shortest of 3 distances to 3 points on the line, that correspond to 3 roots of a cubic function.\n\nother shaders are better at illustrating this inverse.\n\nthe [distance to quadratic bezier] problem is identical to a [point disatance to a parabola AND also shortest point to 2 endpoints anywhere on the parabola] problem.\n\nthis also exists as quartic, where the point distance to an ellipse solves for (up to) 4 roots, that correspond to 4 possibly closest points on an ellipse to any point near the ellipse. and then it pretty mucxh ends (in 2d), as we can only solve quartics, but not solve for 5 (non identical) roots for a (general) quintic.\n\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/XttyWN",

I think I have hidden this by sampling the texture twice (with the modulo wrap in a different location) and blending the two samples.\nThe texture is also sampled with these UV co-ordinates in the raymarch.

Unless you happen to mean a 3D 4-tap version. I wrote one of those, although Voronoiesque would be a more apt description. I'd imagine I'm not the first person to come up with the idea (minimum falloff on a 3D simplex grid), but I included a second-order distance in mine, which I haven't come across elsewhere. It probably needs fine-tuning, and the pattern quality doesn't adhere to strict standards, but it's robust, and looks better than you'd think. In fact, I like it more than the squarish 8-Tap version.",

This is a kind of collection of bad hacks, in some ways.  If you truly want to fix it before that - you're more than welcome to copy/remix it, as far as I'm concerned.  Most of the source shaders are either ShareAlike or not explicitly licensed, so it seems unlikely anyone would mind...\n\nI'm more interested in figuring out how to replicate the concepts I accidentally discovered with more proper physical and 3D modeling.  The hyperdisc has the nice functionality of providing fractal details down to the smallest possible resolution - so I've noticed this shader scales to a fullscreen far better than many of the other noise concepts I'm exploring.  However, that only occurs near the \"infinite tunnel\" near the asymptote of the disc.  \n\nDo you or any others have ideas on how to replicate that \"true fractal\" nature on a more properly modeled ocean/clouds/fire/other physical wavenoise-based phenomena?",

I think you need to use this instead to get a coord system that scales properly:\n\nvec2 uv = fragCoord.xy / iResolution.x;\n\nOnce you've calculated uv I would pass that to the planet function so it doesn't know anything about fragCoord, and everything is drawn in the same coordinate system.

I'm a totally noob about this, not sure if this is really an issue. \n\nSecond: If i post a sound cloud link on Shadertoy, i can't delete the music content anymore, - it should be possible to add \"just a simply empty\" string so the sound cloud music disappears, currently I have to replace it with other music content. \n\nBig Thank you.\nKeep it up",

        "ollj, 2017-09-19there is no clear correlation between the disk and spin of a galaxy, relative to its neighbors or great voids.\n\nthere is no clear correlation between the orbital planes of a planet and the relative position of a star within a galaxy. The relatively small scale spin of a a concatenating cloud that forms a solar system makes one angular momentum dominate within <2 billion years, creating a disk shaped cloud. We can only (almost only) measure extra-solar planets in systems where the orbits are nearly coplanar with out position in space. binary systems simplify this, as we can tell heir spin more easily.\n\nThere is no clear correlation between the compositions of 2 solar systems, wether any gas giant is further inside or outside. There is a significant gap in our observations, a lot of earth like planets could exist, but we fail to measure a most of them in a certain range of mass and density. within a range of measures where we expect to find a lot,we barely find anything.But all around that spot we find gas giants and smaller more dense things.\n\nGalaxy Disks are generally a lot thinner than in your shader. they glow a lot in infrared and often have a ultraviolet beam/halo trough their pole due to a strong magnetic field due to alof of angular momentum with short distances (quasars and black holes)\n\nThere are 2 distinct galaxy types. high density galaxies tent to form disks and have brighter stars with more supernovae.\n\nLower density galaxies have much more and much smaller starts, the galaxies stay larger, and contain more but smaller stars that burn slower, exist longer,have  less supernovae, and they stay spherical and glow mostly yellow.\n\nGalaxies also tent to have smaller galaxies that orbit them, a bit like a moon, but the larger scale orbitals are a lot less stable over time and collisions (colliding dust clouds) will happen.",

        "iq, 2017-11-22Of course it runs faster if you reduce the voronoi search size. But, also of course, I chose those loop limits for a good reason -\n reducing them breaks the image (for the grass elements span beyond 2 grid cells). So that's not an option for me.\n\nThe only way to reduce the loops, as I said, is to generate the grass/moss elements in a way that allows you to know the direction of growth (and hence cell overlap) beforehand without evaluating the full distance field. Then you can explore only the relevant part of the grid. Since that's not easily done at runtime, an option is to precompute it in the first frame of the animation and store it in a buffer where each texel encodes the xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax of the smallest search box for each grid cell that gives correct results.\n\nA classic trick in real applications that render vegetation is to reduce the amount of elements with distance, dof and mblur, and make them thicker to compensate for the lost pixel coverage. That works great for images with a big dynamic range of distances. In this case all the content is concentrated in small distance and with a long lens, so not much can be done. You can still try it by doing     int km = ( pos.z>1.0 ) ? 1 : 2;\n    for( int k=0; k<km; k++ ) in line 300 and float d2 = se2.x - (0.02 + 0.03*se2.y)*((km==2)?1.0:2.0); in line 336. Still, all you get is a win of 1.03x. Probably, because of the way WebGL is unrolling these loops.\n\nAnyway. Yes, I did look into all the alternatives I could think of (and believe me, rendering massive amounts of vegetation efficiently is something I know about).\n\nI might try dr2's hexagonal pattern next time, a 2-ring search should involve 19 cells instead of 25, so there's that, although the density will decrease, so that might require a 3-ring search, defeating the point.

So not only it's useless to optimize shading, but trying to conditionally simplify based on DOF would probably make it more expensive.\n\nThe cost of shadows is almost 0 too (since shadows are found so early on). Not worth trying to reduce number of steps or casting the ray from light to surface instead of surface to light (classic trick to speed things up sometimes). Shadows are not the issue. All the cost is in the intersection/raymarch of the primary ray.\n\nGeometrically, the cost is not the mushroom nor the ladybug. Still, both use bounding spheres right now, but that helps nothing.\n\nAll the cost is in the grass and moss intersection. The 5x5 and 3x3 search kernels are necessary to prevent missing intersections, since moss and specially grass are bent and cross one or two cells. Since the bending is in arbitrary directions, the \"offset search by 1 and reduce range\" trick cannot be applied.\n\nI think the optimization effort should go into either micro-optimizations inside the moss and grass inner loops (for example, the sdLineOri calls on moss could have /dot(b,b) pre-computed since the lengths are fixed, or replacing the sin/cos rotations with a reflect in lines 327), or go all the way and do higher level optimizations such as raymarching with over-stepping + correction?",

The advantage of macro is just for the programmer: more concise (good for trivial small things), plus the only way to have the same function operating on float/vec2/vec3/vec4, plus the only way to overload builtin functions. \n- I'm pretty sure you can have your very complex scene + effect in better perfs and compilation time. Just it suppose you organize correctly at start the structures, algorithmic strategies, and some compromise impacting the early scene design. Learning this on an already writen long project is probably not the best way. As I said earlier, efficient SIMD programming is very different to efficient CPU programming, and in term of compilation burden it is even more different than in terms of perfs. For instance, optimizing by testing if(precondition) do bigwork can indeed be counterproductive. but deferred calcululation, for sqrt or shading, is even more well paying than on CPU.",

        "ollj, 2017-09-18bounding volumes increase frame-rate with squares distance to camera, all gets smaller over distance, duh! A simplest performance tweak is to increase camera distance, at least for the first few frames. increasing the Field of View has a similar effect, the more your view is filled with \"nothing==simpler shapes==filler\" the more fps you get. The trick is to exploit your memory of higher detail, while mostly showing a lowres zoomed out image or something of lower complexity often occluding something of higher complexity.\n\n#define performance differences depend on how you use it in what context. #define performance generally had surprising benefits if only due to:\n- thinking more about structure and symmetry, avoiding repetitions, using swiveling more efficiently (very cheap 90deg rotation) , folding domains, playing topological-manifold - origami. There are some trigonometry paper folding axioms that come down to binomials and sign(a); Used to design window shades and solar panels.\n- less repetition, less code to load, memorize and parse. cognitive load matters. abstraction helps. #define aliases are instances of abstraction. Parsing becomes more like a L-systemsystem, almost a cellular automaton, where, small code can expand a lot. This can appear as if they create more aperiodic tessellations from self, as if information comes from nothing, while actually just being an expanding fractal with simple repeating symmetries. You can exploit this in a long loading bar (bad) or just realize that keeping the iteration cont short is likely for the best. -> if you use a #define very often in very similar contexts, you are likely lacking awareness of a simple symmetry, likely a simple (a)periodic tiling is not being utilized for performance then.\nThe fun part of cellular automata is hat some are even  Turing complete L-system fractals.",

        "ollj, 2017-09-18The main issue is that optimization (and compatibility) always depends on a bias from its context.\nShadertoy is opengl_ES in a javascript wrapper, a very unpredictable context.\nThis can create a lot of arguments over nothing, faulty generalizations and a lot of surprises, like;\n- suddenly 4x performance on older hardware by ading a bounding volume.\n- suddenly it takes 1 second longer to compile all the branches of all the loops and bounding volumes on newer hardware.\n- less branching code runs much slower but frame-rates fluctuate less, making it smoother.\n- less branching code may run a bit faster on newer hardware, by having more support for longer pipelines (16 cores serially execute ~16 operations in 1 clock cycle)\n- more branching code (more bounding volumes) fluctuates a lot more (than expected) in performance, depending on relation between objects and camera.\nAll this is runt-ime optimization, best done with trial and error, possibly using Bayes'_theorem, neural networks or some other differentiating dynamic pointer system.\nIn unpredictable market environments, all you can work with are fuzzy and often temporary (time constrained) trends, an FBM with fewer octaves.\n\n* (local) Static as the default setting:\niq has 2 shaders with bounding boxes around rotating cylinders. This in a different more general more dynamic context. A good basis to simplify, but not a good basis for general assumptions.\nA lot of simplification comes from making relative object properties more static, objects or cameras being less mobile.\nideally place static objects physically within quadtrees. \nEveryone easily underestimates the benefits of using STATIC differential properties for better performance, when differences between 2 thins change less often, or never.\nThe F# language insists on teaching you this, by making \"static\" the default type and by requiring \"mutable\" to be explicitly stated.\nMake many differentials powers of 2, 3 or 5 and things simplify more.\nWhen the relation between object and camera is more constrained, it often makes sense to use some special conservative shortcuts, especially when curvature is simpler, local extremas are easier to estimate (no discontinuities), when an object is mostly convex, when a polynomial can be simplified to (multiple) binomials. \nThis often ends up substituting analysis with a heuristic iterative process, like Newton's method or with a loop that behaves like a binary search that is more implicit and less precise or less mutable, using interval aritmetic for more performance.\nIf your shape is convex and easily differentiable, you can often skip right to its second derivative, and take its curvature for a bounary, to quikly estimate some higher power local extrema.\nfwidth() is low in precision, but generally good enough to very quickly estimate curvature over 2 domains, like SSAO.\n\n* Heuristic loops:\nThe shortcut choice  is to abort a loop when your precision reaches a good enough threshold. That shreshold can be loosened on dynamic conditios.\nThis comes in useful when you calculate [shortest point along a ray to an object], as part of tracing a possible intersection.\nrunning out of time, being far away from the camera, just screw precision, even screw a possible surface further away, just ship it, even with minor errors.\nHeuristics applies the Sunk cost fallacy to analysis.\nHeuristics is generally good enough for visuals, its not like you send astronauts into orbit.\nA raymarching loop is inherently heuristic, twiddle its epsilon and see the difference.\nHeuristics speeds up convergence a lot, often resulting in smoother and higher fps over time.\n\n* The downside to heuristics is that it adds for() loops to your code.:\n* * This is often parsed by adding a branch between every iteration. This can result in slightly slower compile and run time than an analytic approach.\n* * This is often parsed by unrolling the loop, which has the tendency to crash some GFG driver implementations in a stack-heap-collision on old hardware with less memory.\n* * - easily worked around by setting initial constants to very few iterations, \n* * - with a wrapper can benchmark performance and add iterations while framerate stays high.",

Put a bounding plane over the highest point that an ocean can reach. any fragment that goes up and away from this, never touches the ocean, does not need to calculate whatever voronoi noise defines your ocean.\n\nA bounding volume is a special case of a pattern. patterns are defined over domains,dimensions. better patterns exist over N-domains. domains an be swiveled, domains can be parameters of a #define\n\nof\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/llBGzm\nthe function\nAxisSurface()\nshows you how to make a domain (axis) parametric.\nit uses \"pattern\" iteratively. when it is instantiated as \"// Sidewalk top.\"\n\nremove all street lights, remove the bridge, and learn how the sidewalk is defined, basically with a separating boundaries, building up to more complicated \"patterns\"  There is a lot of symmetry in using patterns like this.\n\nusing typeless #define has some tricky issues, basically add extra () to be more explicit on the order of operations just to be save. but its worth trying, because it makes \"distance to sphere\" identical to \"distance to circle\". by generalizing 2 domain specific functions to function over multiple domains,  a 4d torus suddenly becomes relatively simple. and that can be projected back down to 3 or 2 domains in all kinds of useful shapes.",

Cant use it more that I already have here.\n\nBounding volume sounds really interesting. I think I did something similar with my windows, just checking a larger box distance BEFORE allowing the map to reach the actual windows. The performance was alot better, BUT Iq suggested me to remove this due to some compatibility issues with some processors. Would using BVH really help in reducing the loading time or just performance? \n\n\n- \"A key to good compile time is to use the same patterns with different parameters, domains as parameters, and with swiveled domains even if that only lowers loading time, that is still part of parsing time,a parser needing less memory.\"\n\nThat makes me scratch my head. I checked out the example, but that made me even more confused. Dont really get it, but it sounds interesting. \n\nYou sure are very knowledged and skilled Ollj.",

It can make sense to sort Bounding-volumes by TextureID; the same bounding volume can easily contain the same TextureID, making handling of multiple textures simpler.\n\nA key to good compile time is to use the same patterns with different parameters, domains as parameters, and with swiveled domains even if that only lowers loading time, that is still part of parsing time,a parser needing less memory.\n\n---\n\nThis bridges a gap between making a FinalFantasy7 Prerendered static 3d background and using the same geometry for a lower resolution lower detail real-time rendering.\n\ndo not just ban it. just fix your animated preview with a button to overwrite it to a stable static preview.",

Where is the assignment of the colors and the id of each polygon for that assignment?\n\nI have seen in an article of yours about raymarching that you first ask if that point hits something and then if it is true you tell it what color it paints (or whatever shading process it is). That generates 2 ray cycles for each point. One to detect the collision and one to color it.\n\nI don't know if a way to do it would be for you to pass in addition to ro and rd the sdf of the polygon you want. If it collides, calculate again and so you can assign the color and if it does not collide, it would only make the ray once at that point.\n\nI'm sorry for this long message but I can't understand it and maybe someone will give me a hand!\n\nThank you all very much and congratulations for this great job!",

After optimizing it (remove all divisions and the normalize) you'd end up with the formula I have for sdTorus(). It's easier (2D instead of 3D) and also has this nice interpretation (for a donut in the XZ plane):\n\n1. Imagine the torus with 0 thickness and radius t.x. It is just a circle.\n2. Find the closest point on this circle to our point p. This is done by ignoring Y to project p onto the XZ plane p.xz and we call this point x.\n3. Now that we have the closest point on the circle, we can find the distance to the second circle (section), which is length(p - (x,p.y))\n4. We are basically done, every equipotential surface of this function we created is a torus. The only thing left to do is to shift the surface having value/potential 0 by subtracting the thickness of the torus t.y: return length(p - x) - t.y\n\nBasically, the SDF I used is a bit more simple/intuitive (and efficient, since it works fully in 2D, not 3D).

        "huwb, 2014-05-03Your second comment made me think about the difference between the ocean geometry use case and volume rendering. I'll talk about volume rendering (this shader) first and then compare with the ocean case.\n\nAs far as I can tell, for efficient volume rendering, our pixel rays are fixed. Which means we have only one degree of freedom - the sample distances along each ray. We can't avoid the samples moving when the camera strafes/rotates. Thankfully though, the screen is relatively densely sampled (by pixels), and these particular sampling issues are usually not obvious.\n\nSo X and Y are relatively densely sampled whereas Z is not densely sampled at all. This is why keeping the samples semi-stationary in Z makes such a dramatic difference (the point of this shader).\n\nSo we're left to choose the sample distances. And this is what you eloquently referred to as fixed Z vs fixed distance sampling. On Pirates we used a half way between the two, tweaked by eye. I think it would be possible to derive the optimal 'curvature' of the sample positions, and also how much to move the samples when the camera moves foward/backward. Or perhaps change it dynamically based on the camera movement?\n\nPopping occurs when new samples are introduced at new locations. For this shader this happens only at the rear of the view. This can be addressed but that is a different story. But we don't get the kind of popping you are talking about if I understood correctly.\n\nFor the ocean mesh we were snapping the mesh to certain rotations. In this case samples would pop in and out at the sides. The solution is simply to make sure that the verts and edges that pop are entirely offscreen (by making the mesh cover a slightly wider FOV than the screen). Then popping is not an issue - because it is not visible. Does that make sense?",

But its probably already a standard technique in some other field - theres no such thing as a new idea!\n\nThere is at least one algorithm to keep the samples completely stationary: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldXSzn . I'm not sure its useful though because you have to think about how to integrate steps through a volume and it may be awkward to handle samples blending in, whereas it is elegant for the tree approach where samples split/merge (line 228 to 233).\n\nThere might be other ways to get an adaptive sampling based on splits/merges, without doing real intersections with the tree. I have a fuzzy idea about it but wasn't able to get anything written down.\n\nWhat would be really handy is an implementation of either strategy that generates the sample distances efficiently in a shader.

Moving+rotating the set every frame tends to include a bit more mat4() multiplication, which is barely significant. a large set will still have lower precision, the further away the set is from its center.

As we know, pretty much every noise is a bounded distance field (value, gradient, etc..) as long as you guarantee that |gradient| <= 1 (this is often overlooked detail in Perlin's classic gradient noise). It would be nice of course to have true distance field and |gradient| = 1, but even here, if you use smin, it can get pretty low and slow down your ray-marching. So the problem with boundness is not the noise itself, but the fact you may be scaling and adding noise values FBM-style for artistic purposes (say to get less or more roughness) and the resulting complex function is usually not bounded and hard to tune, so at the end you have to scale down your ray-marching step.\n\nSo, what guarantees boundness here is not the underlying noise function, but really the fact you are \"carving\" with the noise = using smooth boolean subtraction operation (smax) instead of adding and scaling noise values. See wlt3z8, where I achieve exact same thing with just a value noise - I did scale noise values a bit to assure |gradient| <= 1, but I didn't modify ray-marching step.\n\nShane, P_Malin: about Voronoi variation / offseting centers, this indeed looks like special case of Power Diagram Voronoi. Just check out my old closest_circle function there, or just hold LMB to see the \"noise\" function. This one is a special case with offsets set to 0 and smin instead of min, which is never-the-less cool modification idea! And of course, Inigo is always good at presenting it in a good use-case.",

In particular, randomizing the sphere locations withing their cell, which is equivalent to evaluating a voronoi pattern, works really well, I have a few Private shaders. The problem is that the search space becomes 3x3x3 or even 4x4x4 instead of 2x2x2, and things get too slow so I haven't published any. I also tried simplexnoise-like tetrahedral tiling to reduce the number of primitives, but I didn't get it to look as good as I wanted (you can try it setting line 23 to 1).\n\nI think the right thing to do to push this further is just embracing the fact that you need to go at least 3x3x3 in order to get truly randomized and smoother noiseSDF, and just deal with it.\n\nI also tried box shapes, but I didn't try shells nor I tried mixing them ll together.

Seriously though, I'd recommend rendering a grid of hexagons to anyone who hasn't done it.\n\n@mackycheese21\nIf you've never put one of these together, I'd start with a simple rendering of a square pylon grid - Refer to the \"blocks\" function in my \"Random Block Passage\" example. After that, render the same with each row or column offset by half a grid cell for that brick-like pattern. At that stage, you can swap the square pylons for hexagonal ones. If you have enough space between pylons, then you only need to render one set of repeat objects. The problem arises when you wish to render them against one another. At that point, neighboring cells need to be considered to avoid artifacts, which means you need to render in groups of four...\n\nYeah, I'd be confused at this point too, but if you try to render a square pylon grid from scratch, I promise you'll figure it out.  \n\n@Nick120100\nThere might be converters out there, but the only way I can think of doing it is by painstakingly replacing the GLSL functions with the Cg\\HLSL equivalents.

There's nothing technically difficult about producing hexagonal grid imagery like this, but having to render four objects (three minimum) to avoid overlap can be costly for anything but the simplest of shape combinations. On a side note, storing some of the calculations ahead of time in a second buffer might go some way toward speeding up the process.\n\nThere are so many variations on this particular hexagonal setup that it was difficult to pick one. Hopefully, someone with more enthusiasm and imagination might put something more interesting together. \n\n@flockaroo and @leonmiura\nIn regard to producing some cheap neon reflections, I'm waiting for inspiration to strike.  My best bet would probably be rendering a low-iteration second pass on a less detailed distance function, etc, so I might add that in at some stage.

I've changed the shader now so that a reflected ray is cast for the first intersection and also if the surface has no transparency or in the case of total internal reflection. I think it has picked up the edge-of-bowl and underside of liquid cases which were not reflecting anything before.\n\nollj - Oops, yes PI was defined twice as I had left a copy of the distance function from one of my very old shaders (Chains and Gears) pasted in there. The RotateX() etc. functions were all part of that code too but were unused. Yes the \"stack\" is now more of a queue. I kept its name as it started out as a stack and I didn't rename it when the usage changed. \"no clue why you think a stack is needed were accumulators would have done nicely\" - well, because that would not handle ray branching from reflection and refraction at each intersection which was what I was investigating in this shader.

I figured someone would eventually emulate a recursively raymarched scene on a stack... unless someone else on here has already done it. It compiles and runs at 10fps on my oldest computer, which is pretty good for that machine. \n\nWith multiple ray examples, I've been taking the easy way out and avoiding recursion altogether by only performing reflection when refraction isn't possible. On abstract scenes, you can almost get away with it. I've tried to do things properly at the first intersection, then launch into the loop on the refractive pass, but that doesn't look quite right either. Either way, there are always performance issues... Of course, it's all relative. I can remember a time when I would have been thrilled to trace a single sphere with just one reflective bounce on a 256 by 256 pixel grid at 2 FPS - or a sizzling 8 FPS with adaptive subsampling.",

I was curious to see how close you can get to original image and what the basis texture would or should look like if you can do full search and don't do anything fancy afterwards. Well, that test tool like 20-30 min of C coding. The answer - you can get super close.\n\nA lot of time was spent on trying to make it actually work in the shader. First draft took maybe 5 min, only compiled in browsers with DX11 backends, ran at 5 fps in a small window and then crashed my GTX Titan when I hit full screen  The rest was iterative approach of optimizing it so it doesn't run out of uniform constants and fails to compile on DX9 and native OpenGL backends, runs at high frame rates.\n\nAlso I took some time investigating different error estimators. MSE in sRGB did 90% of the job but had really bad failures because it is not aware of structures our visual system is sensitive to. But even things like SSIM fail. So I build a list of best candidates with different techniques and then selected them by hand (eye) manually.\n\nIt took a while but I learned a lot \n\nThe next obvious step is to find some procedural basis.",

Way before iDate+tunnel suffers from precision problems, the texture interpolation unit, which works in fixed point and at a relatively small precision, is already lacking bits/decimals. When you divide iDate.w by 10 and the shader looks better is not because you are helping with precision in the floating point arithmetic, but because the UVs are smaller and the HW interpolator has more room for subtexel lerp-ing. You can check this by simply replacing the texture lookup with a sine pattern/wave.\n\nIn any case, the shader needs to be seen at early in the morning ^_^",

(wall, tiles, whatever it is) Anyway, the first texture was lit from the perfect direction so it seems like there is a real displacement in the tunnel.\n\nBtw, there is one problem with using iDate.w in your code. As the day goes by, iDate.w can be relatively large number (for a float). And adding a large number to a small number such as .2/lenght(p) leads to errors. That's why the tunnel is not so nice at large speeds later in a day, especially near the right edge of the screen (where the length is larger) - the texture sampling is affected by this error, and you get blocky edges. So it's another reason why multiplying iDate.w with .1 is a good idea. I tested your program with constants and the rendering looks nice up to about 8000 (seconds). After that the error kicks in. Fortunately, when we divide by 10 it's enough to keep it in such range throughout the day.\n\nI especially like it this way:\n... vec2(atan(p.y,p.x),.2/dot(p,p))+iDate.w*.1 )*length(p);\nIt is brighter, and it doesn't matter if you watch it in the morning or late at night.

        "SebH, 2019-06-27Hi,\nThere is not really any rayleigh scattering in cloud. That is for molecule in the atmosphere. Cloud feature geometric scattering that can be aproximated by Mie as a simplification. Otherwise it is more complex (Figure 2 in http://www-evasion.imag.fr/Publications/2008/BNMBC08/clouds.pdf).\n\nSo for cloud appart from that you can use albedo equal one so absorption=0 and scattering=x. That x for clouds I discuss in https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/eacom/frostbite/files/s2016-pbs-frostbite-sky-clouds-new.pdf with a reference. You can use something between 0.4 to 0.6. lso I have found another one saying it can be up to 0.1 (http://www.patarnott.com/satsens/pdf/opticalPropertiesCloudsReview.pdf).",

And thank you for the atmospheric scattering paper - you are my thesis reference now \nI was using Henyey Greenstain approximation (max between +.6 to .8 forward and a quarter of that backwards so it accounts for some back scattering) but it did look somewhat... unpolished.

What scattering coefficient is considered \"correct\" for pbr clouds? I'm using single scattering and assuming that albedo is close to 1 (using same coefficients for absorption and inscattering). But I can't seem to find a clearly stated: hey, cloud material has these coefficients for (r, g, b) scattering. So far keeping it as (.6, .6, 1.) seemed about right to me but it's haunting me.

It shouldn't matter if your computer is a little slower, that should only affect how fast the shader runs (and if it's slow, you can press 2/3/4 to improve the framerate). If it doesn't load correctly, though, it means there's a bug somewhere. Updating the GPU drivers or browser might help, but of course it's also possible the bug is in the shader. It's hard to say where the issue might be without seeing it myself/being able to reproduce it (since there's a lot of code in here), but in the end, though, it's just a silly shader, so you're not missing much if you've already seen the video",

        "adx, 2018-11-29Another update, this time mostly on performance: I finally got some work done on that front, and after all the optimizations (specialized intersection function for axis-aligned brushes; brush partitions; top-level AABB checks for entities; bounding spheres in inner ray-march loop; texture/mipmap generation only when needed), my GTX 1060 can now render the default 800x450 window at 144 FPS while keeping its idle clock - that's a whole GHz lower than the initial version (and at lower utilization). All in all, current version is about 2.8X as fast, so it *should* run well on lower-end GPU's (famous last words). I've only done some very brief testing on an integrated GPU from the blue team and results didn't seem to agree with my back-of-the envelope math, though, so if you happen to have access to an entry-level GPU (or maybe a high end Apple GPU), I'd appreciate the info \n\nBTW, when I say brush partition, I mean a simple flat list of bounding volumes and associated primitive ranges, which I suppose could be called a BVL - it's basically a flattened BVH. For a while I actually had both types implemented, with a macro to switch between implementations. The BVH was very similar to stubbe's shader, but much shallower (due to compile time constraints), and macro'd to fit in just a couple of lines. After I managed to optimize the BVL compile time significantly, though, I removed the BVH code entirely - I might still bring it back, but only if I come up with another traversal scheme.\n\nFinally, with all the changes I've made so far, I figured it might be pretty cool to be able to compare the current version to the initial one. So, if you'd rather play 'spot the difference' (instead of reading walls of text describing incremental changes), you can do so here.",

I did end up touching most of the brushes, but I've been careful not to affect the playable area in any way. As you can see in the changelog, I actually got carried away for a bit with the optimizations, and ended up reverting some changes when I realized that the teleporter platform in the Easy hallway had been affected. The outside area (visible only with NOCLIP 1 in Buffer A) was changed significantly, and for some reason I'm not totally happy even with that, since it might give the wrong impression - real maps are never this tidy in non-playable areas, especially when you know there's a compiler that will remove the geometry anyway. At the end of the day, the lower brush/plane count and the shorter encoding for the axial planes were a good trade-off, though.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the biggest deviation right now has to be the texturing. I'd like to have another go at it (it's still on the TODO list), but I'm not very confident I can make it significantly better. We'll see...\n\nAnyway, I'm done rambling... for now",

        "adx, 2018-10-20So... it's been a while - I think an update might be in order.\n\nI've been keeping a pretty detailed changelog in the main (Image) buffer - maybe too detailed, since many changes are minor... I'm tempted to trim it down to just the highlights, but for now I think it'll stay as is, maybe someone will find it useful/entertaining in some way. Anyways, here's the TL;DR version:\n\n- Collision map/detection/handling: this is probably the biggest change. I was hoping to come up with a nice, clean implementation. I haven't: corners have been cut, shortcuts have been taken, steps have been skipped - calling it an over-epsilonned kludgy mess would be very generous...  On a more serious note, the code does get the job done: there's wall-sliding, smooth stair climbing, ramp sliding and jumping. The acceleration/friction code is more simplistic than Quake's, but other than that the handling feels pretty close. Performance isn't horrible, at least compared to the actual map rendering.\n\n- Temporal super-sampling: added to cut down the ambient occlusion noise, but it also plays nicely with Unreal-style UV dithering. With TSS_USE_LUMA_DIFF 0 (Buffer D), USE_UV_DITHERING 1 and UV_DITHER_STRENGTH 1.0 (Buffer C) you get something that looks a lot like bilinear filtering, if you're into that sort of thing; add LOD_DITHER 1.0 (Buffer C) and you get trilinear - all still for the low price of a single unfiltered texture sample (and some extra divergence).\n\n- Functional weapon model: another step towards some actual gameplay\n\n- Lighting should be pretty close to Quake with gamma 0.9 now; gamma 1.0 would look too dark against the default (bright) Shadertoy background.\n\n- Fireball particle trail: not particularly impressive, but it really makes the map feel more alive, IMO.\n\n- Pain effects and underwater screen distortion when falling in the lava pit: don't fall, I guess? \n\nOther than that, I've also optimized the brushwork a bit (almost 25% fewer brushes/planes, with no visible changes to the playable area) and its encoding (whole map data fits in 85 lines now) and tidied up the outside geometry (which would normally not be seen with a BSP-based renderer). And speaking of BSP's, I've actually added (some) BSP support to my map processing tool, but the shader experiments didn't go very well - I managed to lock up my system twice while compiling a BSP fork of this shader. After that experience I didn't really want to continue down that path - sorry, laptop/tablet(/phone?) users! Maybe I'll give it another try for Quake 2...\n\nThere's another item on the TODO list that didn't quite make it - the zombies. The best model I could come up with (without blowing up the compile time budget for Buffer B) looked like a wooden mannequin, and without a really good zombie texture I don't think it would've worked. After switching the SDF normal estimation from central differencing to backward differencing compile time for Buffer B did drop by a couple of seconds - maybe there's enough room in there now for a more complicated model. For the time being, though, I'm putting the zombies on hold and I'll try to add some actual gameplay instead. To that end, I might have to do some compile-time optimizations in Buffer A, where persistent state is handled - it takes about 14 seconds now, half of the total compile time on my (admittedly ancient) CPU. I've already done some digging, and the low-hanging fruit there seems to be the function generating the QUAKE text above the Normal hallway. Optimizing it won't be pretty, but it could shave off a second or two.\n\nThere's probably more I could bore you with, but this is already getting pretty long and rambly. Maybe I'll honor the long-standing tradition of people who've done something once and write a blog post about all this...",

        "adx, 2018-08-20Thanks again for all the comments, everyone, looks like we all have fond memories of those days. \n\nA note on performance: while I know a GTX 1060 is capable of 144 fps at 800x450 with ~40% utilization, I'm also well aware of the situation on integrated/low end GPUS. The framerate I had on my underpowered DX4 wasn't really on the list of things I wanted to recreate, so I've already made some changes to reduce the compile time for Buffer B (where the ray-tracing/marching happens), in preparation for adding what's still missing: an acceleration structure and, of course, zombies! I'm still not really sure the BSP traversal won't blow up the compile times way out of proportion (on Windows, at least), but I'd like to give it a try, anyway. No promises, though, limited time and all.\n\nOh, and speaking of compile times - for anyone who wants to experiment with different code constructs, to see which is faster, I've made a quick-and-dirty Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script that hooks the Shadertoy lib and reports the time it takes to do the initial compilation (on page load) and subsequent manual ones.\n\n@theGiallo: Fun fact - the map file I'm using to generate the data in this shader is called groundhog.map, since the only thing you can do is teleport/start over. Those teleporters are essential \n\n@valentin: Reverse-bait-and-switch working as intended, then! Fewer people will probably click on the thumbnail, but those who do get a pleasant surprise.

Not to mention that, as you can definitely tell, I'm a total noob when it comes to procedural generation... I tried to at least not half-ass it, though, so, while it's still obviously coder art, it's at least .75-assed coder art \n\n@Shane: Indeed, it was a fair bit of work for a shader, but it was a labor of love  The shadertoy workflow (with its instant feedback and zero setup boilerplate) was quite addictive at first - IMO it's the perfect mix of creative freedom with just a hint of (stimulating) technical limitations. The superlinear compile times kind of curbed my enthusiasm after a while, but there are still a few things I'd like to try. And yeah, it's amazing how far we've come in terms of sheer computing power - from not being able to do a single perspective division per pixel to casually intersecting >1000 planes! I guess it's good to live in the future \n\n@Dave: I don't think I can take credit for either of those things - I may have peeked at the vkQuake underwater screen warp code, and I may have gotten very friendly with the Gimp color picker (percentage mode FTW) and Trenchbroom screenshots.

Thanks in advance for any help you may provide.\n\n     public void update(SimpleVector cameraPosition) {\n\tshader.setUniform(\"iGlobalTime\", (timeF+=.1f));\n\tshader.setUniform(\"pos\", cameraPosition);\n\tshader.setUniform(\"ray\", waterPlane.getTransformedCenter().calcSub(cameraPosition).normalize());\n     }",

        "ath500, 2023-06-01@TDM\n\nThis is a GLSL shader script for a beautiful seascape scene. The code is already fairly optimized considering it's a shader running on the GPU, and the complexity of the effects it's creating. Nevertheless, there are a few possible minor optimizations and code quality improvements that could be made, but they are unlikely to significantly affect the performance.\n\n1. **Constants and precomputation:**\n   Some values are calculated multiple times, like `uv * octave_m`, `freq * 1.9`, `amp * 0.22`, and `mix(choppy, 1.0, 0.2)`. These could be precomputed and reused, though it's worth noting that modern GPUs are extremely efficient at such computations.\n\n2. **Loops:**\n   You have two loops (`map` and `map_detailed` functions) that are nearly identical except for the iteration count. This repetition could be removed by making a function that takes the iteration count as a parameter.\n\n3. **Function Inlining:**\n   The GLSL compiler should already be doing a good job of inlining small functions like `hash` and `noise` where appropriate, but you can ensure this by manually inlining them if you want. However, this might make your code less readable and maintainable, so it's not necessarily a recommended practice.\n\n4. **Remove unused variables and functions:**\n   If any functions or variables are unused, they should be removed. This is more of a code cleanliness issue than an optimization, but it can help prevent confusion and potential bugs in the future.\n\nRemember, the most important optimizations usually involve high-level algorithmic choices rather than minor code tweaks. The algorithm used here is already quite efficient for the effect it's creating, so there may not be much room for improvement without changing the visual output. It's also important to note that shader performance can be highly hardware-specific, so any changes should be tested on a variety of different GPUs to ensure they actually improve performance.",

        "ath500, 2023-05-25This is a well-structured and detailed shader creating an impressive and immersive ocean simulation. It effectively represents the sea's surface with great lighting, reflections and wave forms, leading to a realistic ocean visual. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Constants & Sea Parameters**: You have defined some crucial constants, the notable ones being `SEA_HEIGHT`, `SEA_CHOPPY`, `SEA_SPEED` and `SEA_FREQ`, which control the sea's general appearance. `SEA_BASE` and `SEA_WATER_COLOR` dictate the sea's base color and reflected color, respectively.\n\n2. **Math & Noise**: The `fromEuler`, `hash`, and `noise` functions form the basis for the sea surface's randomized yet continuous appearance. The Perlin noise generated by the `noise` function, based on Ken Perlin's work, is a gradient noise, giving the sea's surface a realistic randomness.\n\n3. **Lighting**: The `diffuse` and `specular` functions help to simulate the sea's light absorption and reflection properties. This plays a significant role in bringing realism into the scene by providing depth and color variations based on light interactions with the water.\n\n4. **Sky & Sea**: The `getSkyColor` and `getSeaColor` functions simulate the sky and sea's color based on the given inputs. `sea_octave` function helps to generate the sea surface's wave patterns. The use of a Fresnel term in `getSeaColor` enhances the realism by correctly simulating light reflection and refraction based on the angle of incidence.\n\n5. **Geometry & Tracing**: The `map`, `map_detailed`, `getNormal` and `heightMapTracing` functions are responsible for creating the sea's geometry and performing ray tracing on the generated surface. `heightMapTracing` is particularly interesting as it enables the shader to mimic the camera's perspective and depth effects.\n\n6. **Main**: The `getPixel` function combines all of the above to generate the final color for each pixel. The `mainImage` function applies anti-aliasing, using a 3x3 grid for each pixel to reduce the aliasing effect. \n\nOverall, a highly impressive shader. Great work on capturing the dynamic essence of an ocean surface! The level of detail and realism here is truly commendable.",

The shader itself, its underlying principles of generating waves, mixing in nice colours and reflections, can be isolated, extracted and redone within other systems.\n\nWith all that said, TDM's work still stands on its own and continues to inspire and awe countless people - like the guy I mentioned in my original comment",

Meshes and vertices produce inaccuracy in the modeling, in much the same way that an MP3 is lossy when it comes to sound - because instead of modeling the actual position of the wave height at any given point between vertices, you're approximating it...now of course with modern shaders you can (and need to) do a lot better than simple lerps, and model actual curves, but even in the best of AAA titles these days I can still usually see a vertex transition that isn't curved well enough if I'm really looking.\n\nBut there are many reasons this shader excels - excellent specular reflections, great color choices, and also in particular noise modeling that accurately simulates real ocean surfaces.\n\nI don't know that one would be able to translate this model well to a mesh-based approach somehow - but I don't know that one wouldn't, either.

        "ttg, 2021-12-07In 2013 there may have been more severe issues with conditionals handling by shader compilers than now.  That said, likely any performance difference here (I can measure none) is thanks to the simplification of the expressions (good job!) but not involving branching.\n- AMD has register selection instruction, Nvidia has conditional move instruction, both are SIMD and branchless.  The code computes both sides of the conditional and then selects the correct one.  Using arithmetic to select values just wastes FMA ops.\n- Branching allows a thread to skip code (advance the program counter) only when all fragments in the thread agree on having no use for that condition.  There's nothing much more costly about this than unconditionally never skipping the code who's results might not be used, it's just an extra \"jump if all values in vector are zero\" instruction.\n\nWhy I point this out is that here, in this shader, with or without USE_BRANCHLESS_DDA, there is no major divergence forcing any fragments in a thread to be useless for extended periods of time.  getVoxel remains always fully parallel between fragments.\n\nAs someone pointed out, breaking the loop after a solid voxel is found is a useful optimization.  It is in fact deliberately using branching to finish earlier: nearby fragments often complete their loops after similar numbers of iterations, when the scene surface encountered spans across these fragments.  Fragments which are physically nearby in the image (grouped by small rectangles) are placed together into each GPU thread for specifically this reason.",

(or you accidentally made some great function you never dreamed of)\nbut if your function is symmetrical, you will notice that more and more things cancel each other out easily, while you substitute in all the directions. practice builds intuition.\n\nthe core goal is the identity: sign(a)*sign(a)=1. ,to substitute forwards to. anything that becomes 0 or 1 (or +-0.5).\nSadly you can not always rely on a/a=1. within IEEE float types. division by 0 more likely makes your code incompatible.\n\nthis makes more sense applied to more symmetrical functions, where a branch has 2 paths with roughly equal and very simple arithmetic. it also makes more sense to make code branchless that uses few variables, and to not have loops with many iterations return parameters into branchless code. \n\nBranchless code should be \"low level routines\", and the mainImage() branches can easily stay \"if()else\". You substitute till you get just that, a \"binary tree\" where everything is evenly branched, a perfect garden where you know that you can not remove anything more, the dream of an OpenCL coder.",

Currently trying to find a way to fix this as it's much better to know exactly what the end user sees.\n\nAlso there are several other magic values that will work. Also working on those.\nfloat grid_position = fract( dot( fragCoord.xy, vec2(1.0/16.0,10.0/36.0) + 0.093 ) ); for example also works fine.\nFrom messing about with the magic values for mine I can also find patterns that looks very similar to valves dither which tells me that the two methods are related - I think mine has better magic values though. They use a different method for chromatic - I might experiment here but my current method of ensuring one component goes down in value when the two others go up and vice versa works well.\nOut of the methods on display here mine is still my favorite. Second favorite is chromatic blue noise. Note that mine is chromatic by default.

        "CeeJayDK, 2014-05-28It shifts some pixels towards green and some towards purple. It looks odd here because you reduce the number of colors so the banding is exaggerated, but the idea is that instead of shifting the color of the pixel to one shade brighter or darker when dithering, you only shift one subpixel, thus you get a finer pattern. Like what sub-pixel anti-aliasing does for font-smoothing.\n\nYou can make the color shift more apparent by reducing the dither_bit value (for demonstration purposes - it should look best with a dither_bit of 8.0).\n\nI use green/purple because green is the color component that appears the brightest so I wanted to juxtapose that with the two other color components, (red and blue) which together make purple.\n\nYou can also use yellow/blue : (dither_shift, dither_shift, -dither_shift)\nor red/cyan : (dither_shift, -dither_shift, -dither_shift)\n\nor disable this feature with (dither_shift, dither_shift, dither_shift)\n\nAs for the diagonal dithering .. that's completely wrong. A bug introduced when I ported it from HLSL to GLSL incorrectly.\n\nI've tried fixing it and I think this is correct : \n\nfloat grid_position = fract( dot( gl_FragCoord.xy - vec2(0.5,0.5) , vec2(1.0/16.0,10.0/36.0) + 0.25 )  );\n\nThat should look far better than the buggy pattern.\n\nI also noticed a flaw in the original version (before porting). I normally the + 0.25 bit as a protection against precision problems, but it should be outside the dot() not inside it. This means this pattern (which still works) was created and tuned with this mistake in place, and so I should go back to my original code, correct that and see if there isn't an even better pattern I have overlooked.\n\nYou can create new patterns by playing with the vec2(1.0/16.0,10.0/36.0) part. New fractions give different patterns.\nI started with a simple checkerboard pattern :\nfloat grid_position = fract( dot( gl_FragCoord.xy - vec2(0.5,0.5) , vec2(1.0/2.0,1.0/2.0)  ) + 0.25 )",

In a normal code (not a shader) you don't need to compute any history, but in this case you loose a lot of interesting stuff for sure. But as long as you compose and tune everything for that it is ok.\nRunning IIR filter multiple times doesn't do much, in most cases it would be the same as running a single filter with a higher Q. It would basically amplify frequencies near the cutoff more.\nAs for FIR then it's a completely different filter by nature and it doesn't have any properties of IIR - it doesn't resonate. Running IIR filter the way it's done in this shader is not the same as running FIR filter of the same window size.\nThere are cases when you would prefer FIR filters like mixing, where you don't want any resonant properties and don't want to have any phase shift.",

I've explained it in my \"Cellular Tiled Tunnel\" example. The downside is animation. You can animate it, but it doesn't have the same feel. Incidentally, the edge detection in that particular example is rolled into the curvature calculation.\n\nThere are also countless other pseudo-random geometric surface patterns that look interesting.

However, if you take the comments away, there's not a great deal of code to this.\n\nA lot of things here have been faked for the sake of speed. For instance, I've used the object's geometry to offset the texture lookup just a little in order to trick the eyes into believing a little ray bending is occurring. The shiny reflective look is mainly caused by two things; The specular lighting and the fake environment mapping. All work together to give it a bit of a perspex\\glass kind of feel. The edging and contrasty palette give it a slight comic effect. If you look at the code, you'll see that each component only takes up a few lines.\n\nBy the way, I'll do a more realistic glass related example at some stage.",

        "lahwran, 2021-02-09hello have a braindump I hope this enriches your life because I really should be doing something else right now.\n\nso it doesn't seem like this network is likely to be using its weights very efficiently. I haven't done the detailed investigation to know this for sure - to do that, I'd do visualizations of the output volumes of each layer of the network, to see what the intermediate representations are - but the big tell is those high freqency artifacts on the surface of the bunny, if it was using its low frequency features ideally it wouldn't need those high frequency ones.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10739.pdf it might be interesting to try a network like this, one where the sinusoidal is on the input rather than as an activation function. that allows regularizing the number of sinusoidal inputs you need: for the first layer, initially start too wide, eg 16 or 32 or even more fourier features, and use model compression style regularization to set input connections to zero - l1+fading-in soft-l0, no l2, sample n nonzero weights per output column on the input matrix each training example - outputting to an 8-wide output. that gives you input feature selection. then, feed that through some number of 4x4 mults to a few different activation functions. might also be worth looking at trying multi-bias. at least one of the activation functions should probably be something smooth like sigmoid or tanh or smoothstep or something else that provides additional smoothness in the mid layers, also probably pow(relu(x), 2.) or something would help with distance calculation. in other words - use operations that have a similar shape to what is typically used in shaders (just a few branches and distance calculations), and evaluate it in a space that allows it to select its position representation. that should allow compressing more. if you really want to spend compute on it, one could try automl, I'm not up to date on what options there are for serious automl for tiny networks like this but the full-space output supervision means there's a good shot at evolving an efficient network.\n\nThen, once you have that working, you could then train a network like this for every pose of a model and initially give it massively overcomplete input representation of concat(fourier_features(model_pose_state), fourier_features(3dnearest_2d_texel_pos), fourier_features(model_space_xyz)) and use the initial regularized matrix to feature-select out of those, and then evaluate it in screenspace to sdf-trace through a higher resolution version of the model in the implicit space of the neural network. If done right this should allow combining an actual mesh model and texture with a neural SDF upsampler, thereby allowing faking much higher resolution detail than a texture bumpmap otherwise allows. though, maybe you'd need to tell it the relative position in a texel, and feed it one texel to give it information on what kind of upsampling to do in that texel. or maybe you'd need to give it the four adjacent texels as input and have it figure out if it needs to use them? it also really depends on your final compute budget, but my hope is that this allows compressing models enough to render them on lower end devices, which means using a low res texture and the tiniest model manageable. if you're instead going to use a high res texture, then an option might be to use entirely different weights in different regions of the texture, thereby completely replacing the concept of bump map textures.",

So the mod(iTime) will contain the camera position around the origin and will fix his problem.\n\nThen the inevitable will still occur some time later (hopefully an order of magnitude or two later) which is the pollution / loss of precision of iTime itself. To fix that (ie, delay it further), the mod() should be done in full 64 bit in the Javascript layer, before the iTime gets sent to the GPU.",

        "stegu, 2022-02-17After spending quite a lot of thought on this last night, I feel a need to qualify my previous statement. This pattern has low frequency content, true, and it will alias rather badly when you try to frequency clamp it, but it's not quite for the reason I thought.\nThe low frequency variations in gradient length impact the pattern in a multiplicative manner, and because of how gradient noise is generated, and because this is a 2-D noise and not a cut through higher dimensional noise, the pattern will still have zero mean, even locally. It's not like value noise, which does have low frequency content all the way down to DC. So, why doesn't frequency clamping solve the aliasing problem?\n\nThe answer to that is twofold: gamma and bump.\n\nFor a pattern with a local variation of zero mean to actually look like its average color at a distance, any high contrast variation needs to be created in a linear color space. RGB and sRGB are most definitely not linear. They are deliberately designed not to be. Once again, we are reminded not to add things in a gamma corrected intensity value and expect to get away with it.\n\nThe second reason is that noise is often used for bump mapping, and bumps do not influence the reflected intensity in a symmetric manner. Without specularity, any bumps will reduce the average intensity of the surface, partly because the Lambertian approximation, the \"cosine law\" with dot(N,L), has a variable slope that ends up taking away more than it adds to the reflection, and partly because of the horizon cutoff -- when dot(N,L) turns negative you clamp it, because it doesn't make much sense to compute with negative intensities. In the presence of any kind of specularity, we have the opposite problem: bumps with highlights will add a lot to the average intensity, regardless of their frequency. If you are to do frequency clamping to remove a high frequency bump pattern on a specular surface, you should also make adjustments to the specular reflection model, the \"Phong exponent\", to compensate for the loss of non-zero-average fine detail near the specular reflection angle. With HDR specularity and a linear colorspace, this particular problem is exacerbated rather than alleviated. RGB saturates on specular highlights, while HDR does not.\n\nFunny how problems always become more nuanced the more you think about them. I am a lot more confused now than before I gave this more thought...",

Frequency clamping assumes that noise above a certain frequency averages out to zero across a fragment/micropolygon of a size larger than the noise feature size, \"one wiggle\". Using this function in a frequency clamped fractal sum would make the pattern either change visibly as you zoomed out, or start to crawl from aliasing before you could drop the term that causes it.\n\nI have an AA fetish, true, but production quality software shaders have been required to do their own AA for decades.

But doing so somehow creates a wide band spectrum using just one (or fewer) level, which some artists sometime like too, plus the more handles the more happy they are ;-) ( at least we seemed to think it was a good idea at the time.

Sadly, very few people seem to have adopted it, as I see finite difference approximations being used everywhere, and that carries an almost crushing penalty.\n\nThe reason I brought it up here is that the derivatives of simplex noise, and the second derivatives as well if you need them, are a *lot* less work to compute than for \"classic\" gradient noise with sequential interpolation, because the noise is just a sum of contributions from the corners (and fewer corners as well) rather than an interpolated product of high-order polynomials.",

The hash used here for the gradient returns independent values for x and y, which results in many short gradients, and the final noise field has a lot of low frequency content (flatter gray areas). The hash is also generally very bad for this purpose, creating lots of periodic artefacts. Most implementations of simplex noise, including Perlin's slightly buggy original version, pick all gradients to be of the same length but different directions.\n\nModern 2D and 3D simplex noise functions that can compute their analytic derivatives at a very low additional cost are here:\n\nhttps://github.com/stegu/psrdnoise/\n\nOur old functions from github.com/ashima (mirrored at github.com/stegu/ after Ashima went out of business) are still useful, but I recommend the more recent ones. There is some old and stale code in the Ashima versions that was required to spoon feed stupid non-optimizing GLSL compilers a decade ago. The new versions I link to above are faster on modern GPUs, in particula the 3-D version. (You also get 3-D flow noise with that, which is a novelty.)",

Mathematically they are the same. \u2207 (f)\u00c2\u00b7L = \u2207L(f).\n\nIn the context of 1k raymarched intros, where every byte counts and expectations on lighitng are low, it's even better, because, by definition, f(x)=0 at the intersection point, so you can compute your gradient/derivative with only one evaluation of f:\n\n\u2207L(f) \u2250 [f(x+\u03b5L) - f(x)]/\u03b5 = f(x+\u03b5L)/\u03b5\n\nThere's such example here: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsfGzM\n\nAs for the texture trick, yep, Dave_Hoskins and I iterated on this at some point in the past.

This has with the following side effects:\n- with VERY few exceptions, rays need much less iterations, and this lets us do MUCH more iterations on the near-parallel/singular/asymptotic cases (100000 steps become feasible in 30 fps for such cases, but such large values are less compatible)\n- is very good for very distorted (hwightmapped or polar-deformed) shapes.\n- close to the camera it understeps a LOT, allowing for VERY good reflections, ad very little extra cost.\n- it oversteps only further away from the camera, where this is not as bad (only noticeable for reflections that need more precision), but it sure DOES overstep (its just not as visible because its FAR away)\n- further away from the camera, objects blow up like baloons, till they completely fill all convex-areas. this makes logarythmic-epsilon worse for caves and it needs fine tuning for vonvexity of the set. This can be fine tuned against, but often is barely noticable. one trick is to just diter this (only every 2nd pixel is logarythmic)",

So obvious that you need a periodic function to deal with values that are limited to a specific range, such as angles. The solution is elegant, so I'll add it.\n\nHowever I don't want the flare to animate based on time. The flare is meant to actually be used as a flare and you'll get weird shimmering if you're standing still and have plugged time into the noise function. So I added flare position instead of time as it was before.",

This one is exceptionally nice - I can see you've even gone through the trouble to triple up for the chromatic effect. I noticed a seem line in the main flare object. Don't quote me on this, but I think it's due to the fact that the value \"ang\" won't wrap unless you run it through a sinusoidal term.\n\nIn other words, \"noise(ang*k)\" wouldn't wrap, but \"noise(sin(ang*k + t))\" would... I'm pretty sure that's the case, but I'm not willing to bet money on it. \n\nJust as an example, something like the following should work:\n\nf0 = f0 + f0*(sin(noise(sin(ang*2. - iTime/2.)*4.0 - cos(ang*3. + iTime/2.))*16.)*.1 + dist*.1 + .8);\n\nOf course, that wouldn't work in with the aesthetics, but I'd imagine that a tweaked version would.",

Also TDM's trick makes it more water like. There is no subsurface scattering here.\n\n@Shane\nGood point, for large pos.z factor the reflection is very biased. Your solution with \"normalize(nor - normalize(rd + .5)*.2)\" looks nice, but sometimes I feel that reflection is too bright. Nevertheless I think your solution is better, in case of tunnels, since it is not dependent on position.\nAs of using texture based noise, indeed it is faster, but unfortunately in case of this shader I get too much banding. It is almost always a tradeof qulity vs speed.\nBTW I like very much your shaders with a lot of descriptions. Good work, man!",

Just a minor thing, but with regards to the additional specular lighting trick, I was wondering what will happen as the z-position component (pos.z) gets sufficiently large? If the object is to offset the normal in a random, contour-like (?) way, would something like \"normalize(nor - normalize(rd + .5)*.2),\" or similar, work? Either way, it looks cool, so I'm going to keep it in mind. \n\nI've made a few \"tunnel through noise\" examples. Although, two levels is the absolute most I can get running at full frame rate on my slower machine, and that's with IQ's fast, textured version. Because value noise has a voxelized feel, I find that a squarish tunnel blends in a little better... Not perfectly, but better.\n\nIn theory, I guess it'd be possible to set various cube corners to zero in the noise function, set up a spline curve and do it that way, but I have a feeling that'd be more trouble than it's worth.",

In Shadertoy there is a special texture \"Keyboard\" which if I remember correctly is a 256 x 3 texture where the x co-ordinate is a keycode to lookup and the y co-ordinate is what you want to query about the key. y=0 tests if the key is currently pressed, y=1 is the \"debounced\" keypress (i.e. is this the first frame the key was pressed) and y = 2 reads a state bit which is flipped each time the key is pressed.

I usually try to make a note of it in the comments. Either way, I've been meaning to post a cleaner, more up-to-date version of this, so I'll put it on my list of things to do.",

Amazing that it's sat there for years unnoticed. I'll comment the line out. In fact, I'll take it all out to avoid confusion. You'll note that in examples I've written since, I don't take that step. One thing that I tend to implement to alleviate popping is checking for the absolute distance, just in case the ray traverses too far into the surface... It doesn't always work, but you'd be amazed at how often it helps.\n\nAnother thing to note is the high surface hit threshold of \".005.\" I used to raymarch stuff before this site went up -- when computers were still pretty slow, so a common threshold today -- like \".001\" -- that required more iterations was considered a luxury. It needs to be lowered, but I might leave it there for posterity. In fact, this example needs a revamp. I might put together a more polished trapezoidal noise version.",

Shadertoy).\n\nRendering goodies:\n- HDR with dynamic exposure\n- Atmospheric scattering with clouds and discrete ozone/airglow layers\n- Atmospheric multi-scattering is emulated by applying heuristics derived from the Delta-Eddington two-stream radiative transfer theory\n- Analytical solution to underwater scattering\n- Analytical anisotropic antialiased 2D primitives\n- Analytical 3D primitives with full-umbra soft shadows\n- Non-lambertian diffuse shading model for terrain ('lunar lambert')\n- Non-gaussian phase function and NDF (disk-integrated) for clouds and ocean specular reflections\n- Uses internal color space with monochromatic RGB primaries (615, 535, 445 nm)\n- Simulates night vision (rod and cone adapation)\n- Starfield with 9072 stars following a power law fit of the catalogue magnitude distribution\n\nSimulation:\n- Simulated world is 480 km in diameter\n- Surface gravity is 4 times that of earth\n- Weight of the aircraft is reduced to 1/4, so wing loading and landing speeds remain the same\n- The simulated aircraft is a blend of the coefficients from 3 parts F-16 and and 1 part Shuttle orbiter ...",

Basically, I'll try a cheaper short-cut version, then hope that it looks OK.\n\nIn this particular instance, the refracted imagery is a good example. In reality, you'd have to restrict some kind of moving viscous membrane to the tubes, then perform a whole heap of refractive and reflective bounces whilst gathering up material properties - which isn't possible in realtime with the average computer. Therefore, I've settled for indexing a refracted ray at a uniform length into a viscous like function and leaving it at that. The weird thing is that our brain expects to see a certain result based on the scene, does the calculations anyway, and distorts the membrane to suit the result. It's far from perfect (transparency is lacking), but our minds will vaguely accept it.\n\nIn addition, I saved a lot of distance calculations by tweaking the raymarching loop, bump mapping the cellular walls, doing some fake, localized shadowing, etc. Bump mapping the finer details is one of the oldest tricks in the book and always worth the trouble, if you can get away with it.",

However, smoothly combining a perturbed cyclinder with the gyroid surface - plus some tweaking - can produce a pretty interesting multiple tunnel system. I did something similar in my \"Abstract Island Cavern\" example. The downside with some transcendental surfaces, such as these, is honing difficulty, which is why the raymarching loop look so hacky. There are probably better ways to address the issue, but none that I'm clever enough to come up with. \n\n@Dave and @Virgill\nI slowed the camera down to half the speed. Any slower than that, and people would begin to realize that just how much fake physics is included.  As for the FOV, I agree that it's a little restrictive. I think I chose it to hide some near camera honing glitches, but I'll take another look at it.",

This imagery is unique, but draws upon geometrical elements from common patterns - Hexagonal mazes, Truchets, isometric cubes, impossible geometry, etc. Anyway, I put this up hoping others would create some really interesting patterns that I might learn something from.\n\nFor anyone not quite familiar with the concepts in this shader, the knowlege could be assimilated in an afternoon - since it's nothing more than applying some basic geometry and very rudimentary Photoshop layering techniques. Geometrically speaking, some circular and hexagonal shape portions are placed at certain spots on a hexagonal grid cell, which is pretty easy.\n\nThe rest is application of fundamental steps that the average Photoshop user is familiar with. Render a masked shape layer, apply borders, drop shadows, bevels, etc. In WebGL pixel shader terms, that is just is just a case of correctly applying the \"smoothstep\" function, manipulating distance fields, applying gradients, and so forth.",

If you don't feel like sifting through the code, I explained the moving UV coordinate component in the introduction. In short, I used the distance field value as the radial coordinate, and a wrapped angular component. What I couldn't say is whether it would extend to your generalized example...

On this shader it mainly accumulates when rays are almost parallel to the surface (more iterations with small distances).\nGlow is mixed with the color of the surface, so it appears like a transparent halo, you can see through the glow, like a translucent peel.\nWe are in voxelized space (3D space divided into \"big\" cubes), so this glow is still there but appears as cubes instead of smooth surface.\nThe sphere shader, but in voxel space:\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/llKBWR",

In my experiments, your sampling method is broken along the z axis with the texture provided by shadertoy, as well as with a completely random texture of my own... but it *does* work when the green channel of every pixel equals the red channel of the pixel offset from it by (37,17), which makes sense deducing things from the code.

The macro would combine individual pixels into a float value, to be extracted later using SELECT (since a float could only hold up to 8 pixels, SPR_H was defined so it would split the row into two values).

Tri-planar mapping might roughly work, but only bump mapped.\n\nThat leaves tileable 3D diffusion packed into a 2D texture, and so far, I've been feeling too lazy to try that.  Having said that, Shadertoy user \"cornusammonis\" has a really nice example along those lines.",

Otherwise, just subtracting NaN from NaN would produce NaN. (unfortunately, I don't know how to see final shader assembly on mac and check that...)\nThat's probably why on mac mini those \"o -= o - X\" doesn't work. It's possible that compiler can't figure out that it could just \"clear c\" and then subtract X, but it rather subtract X from o (getting NaN), and then subtract the result from o (again getting NaN).\nWhen it is written explicitly as \"o = o - o + X\" then it is probably detected and optimised into clearing of c and adding X which gets rid of the NaN.",

This takes time, + competition between the texture processors ( there are several burst mode specific to textures, but I don't think there are broadcast modes ).\n\nBTW the starting of threads + the end of threads are classical issues in parallelism: the start because there is often a huge competition to access data, and the end because the whole process often wait for the last outliers thread to finish - could be very few so no longer really \"parallel\".\nOn Cuda you can try to organize the code smartly to spread init access + to equalize chunks of thread content (e.g. scheduling rays segment), but on GLSL we generally can't do much.",

Not using *2 to avoid aliasing and artifacts.\n\nRaymarch steps from ro (ray origin) along rd (ray direction) and adds a light computation along the way. The lighting is pretty simple the brightness is linear with cloud density, and there is some extra glow added if dif is large. Dif is an approximate occlusion test - the density in the sun direction is calculated, and if it is clear then assume the sun can reach the cloud and make it glow.",

I am trying to make a tool for generating clouds and am struggling with light calculations right now... I was hoping you could help clear something up for me.\nScenario - camera is at the ground, I intersect two spheres with each ray (planet center with radii of planet radius + cloud bottom/top) and then sample some textures in between to get shapes. Nothing too special. However, when I accumulate light it all goes WILD! Clouds either darken too quickly or everything is way too bright based on how I'm trying to do it.\nI'm trying to do it the way Real time rendering book explains - phase  * visibility * incident light * PI at each step for inscattering, exp(-density * stepSize) for extinction... don't want to blow this comment too long. If I put my shader here on shadertoy I was hoping if someone knowledgeable like you would give me a few pointers on why it's so wrong... \nI don't expect anyone to do it for me, but I simply lack understanding on how to combine these elements and how to integrate them properly, and a few tips on that would be great. \nSorry for the novel size comment",

According to other cloud renderers based uppon the 2015 Horizon Zero Dawn presentation, muE would actually be the density over the distance, and is usually combined (since it has to be integrated) into \"density along light ray\".

Shaders can be great teaching tools, but if you write code like @FabriceNeyret2, it destroys readability and removes the benefits of shaders for no benefit.

Hyperbolic all the things!\n\nShane, [appoloneus of perga] was great with first derivatives of quadratic functions, but lacked comprehension of (ancient times) calculus to do 2nd derivatives of cubics, which made him good in circle-packing and coplanar math but limited at conic sections, parabola, frustum culling, and 3d to 2d projections.\n\nthe trick to fast (pseudo) circle packing (that is modulated and not necessarily an iterated fractal like this shader, for performance) is to define a triangle lattice of simplexes, in 2d, 3d, 4d,5d,and its especially useful in 8d, and then take a lower dimensionally shadow/hyperslice (in 2d or 3d) of it. (for starters: a planar slice trough a 3d simplex lattice of stacked spheres, then you rotate and move the plane of the slice to change it, the more domains the more weird it gets, 8d spherepacking has special super-symmetry to exploit here!).\nas basis for this tri-lattice use\nfloat F=0.36602540378;//sqrt(3.)*.5-.5\nfloat G=0.21132486540;//(sqrt(3.)*.5-.5)/sqrt(3.)-.5-(.5/sqrt(3.))\nfloat TAU=6.28318530718;\n//https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xs2fRd  \n//to interpolate between square and tri-lattice a lot of hashes are nice for both extrema, but discontinuous for any in-between.\nvec2 skew(vec2 p){float f=(p.x+p.y)*F;return p+vec2(f,f);}\nvec2 unskew(vec2 q){float g=(q.x+q.y)*G;return q-vec2(g,g);}\n\nan advanced approach uses aperiodic iterations over modulated lattices, with domain folds of more domains down to less domains. if comes down to 2x3 and 3x2 matrices (and their spheremapped-pseudoo-inverses), and lots of loop accumulating.",

I no longer own the address I signed up with, so don't receive site messages.\n\nIt helps to know what things the GPU likes and doesn't like, but I tend to find that the same old optimization principles used back in the software engine days still apply, like minimizing instruction count in the most used functions. Back in the day, a lot of effort used to be put into things like triangle routines, then minimizing the number of times you called them via culling methods.\n\nIn this particular case, it helps to optimize the distance function, then try to minimize the number of calls to it by tweaking the raymarching loop. The particular surface rendered here doesn't involve too many instruction and is relatively easy to hone in on. In addition, the surface-hit epsilon has been relaxed, which effectively decreases the number of distance function calls even further.\n\nOn top of that, the finer surface details have been taken out of the distance function altogether and bump mapped instead. It looks roughly the same, but involves far less work... In the end, if you save a few instructions here and there, it begins to add up.",

This particular structure was raymarched, which is a form of raytracing.\n\nWith the benefit of precalculation, you could definitely polygonize it and rasterize that way - by feeding the isosurface into the \"Marching Cubes\" algorithm... or some better technique I'm not thinking of at present. In fact, based on past experience, it'd be way faster to push out triangles, even at that level of detail. However, the method is nowhere near as elegant.",

People in literature call it to direct light sampling which also was confusing for me. As you might notice already sampleBSDF function returns hit information including material, normal and so on and inside loop I use 2 structs to store data for current and next event. That's why I added that comment, but anyways I will change it to not confuse people. I will also add links for papers.\nThanks for commenting",

In the literature \"next event estimation\" is used to express the light sampling for reasons that have always confused me too.\nCool shader anyways, probably a lot to learn for beginners.",

        "Tater, 2022-01-22@FabriceNeyret2, Sure I put them as a define. \n\nThere's 3 main \"tricks\" here that I used. The first one is simple, it's just the perspective trick for the penrose triangle and I added a little bit of an extra overhang on one end for the AO calculation, I learned that from the yx penrose shader.\n\nThe second trick is the voronoi crumble. In order to get it to be continuous I first rotate the coordinate space so that the x and y directions are parallel to the camera plane, then for the z dimension I use the ray length relative to the first time it hits the outer part of the triangle, that way the length passed to the voronoi will be the same regardless of how far back it is. This causes issues with the normal calculation which I was sorta able to fix but in the end I just used iteration shading anyway to cover it up. \n\nThe third trick is for the moving blocks, I do the same as with the voronoi crumble where I rotate space so the x and y are parallel for the camera, then I rotated them perpendicular to the sides of the triangle and everytime they pass the half way point they get teleported super far behind or super far infront of the triangle so it looks like they rotate around it. \n\n@tdhooper, the convincing part is probably because I used a different distance metric for the voronoi max(p.x,max(p.y,p.z)) instead of length(p)",

The idea to use rotated grids to produce hashless minimal instruction Voronoi-looking patterns came to me when I was sleeping, believe it or not. There are hashes for offsets here, but they can be hand picked. It's also possible to precalculate and store 3D Voronoi in the faces of the cube map, but it's a lot of work.",

That led to me wasting 10 minutes tweaking, and I came up with this, which goes at the end: \n\nfloat bw = (col.r+col.g+col.b)/3.; // light value\ncol -= bw; // pure colour values\ncol *= 0.8; // desaturate\ncol += vec3(.2,.2,-.2)*(bw-.4); // add yellow to bright areas, blue to shadows\n    \ngl_FragColor = vec4( col+bw, 1.0 ); // add colour to light\n\nIt's not right still, but I figured it's worth posting up. You can get a nice daylight tone curve (blue shadows, yellow highlights), desaturate a little, and change brightness/contrast if you want (\"bw = (bw-0.5) * 0.8 + 0.5;\" will drop the contrast).",

You might try to explore that.\nBut here the configuration is pretty simple: there are only 2 places, where only a V can occurs, and you know where. you might split the spline in 2 at that point and sum.\n\nNote that the inside of the top part of the hearth should also be brigther that the outside, if you want to be precise ;-)  .

That's why in my edge detection code, I had to make sure to maintain 3 consecutive distance values and only update the minimum if there was some increase afterwards. But this just seems to work.",

As it is normalized, it could easily be stored as vec3() for the cost of a.w=1.-a.x-a.y-a.z (like in barycentric3d)\nQuaternions are only less precise than EulerRotations for small angles, this is addressed via 2 cases within qBetween() below:\nThis is because we divide by the angle between 2 vectors to normalize the quaternion. You may just want to defer that.\nTo construct a quaternion as a rotation between 2 points around vec3(0), http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlRotBetween has a quite famous [replacement] function\n, that is translated to opengl as; qBetween() of https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wl3yDs\nqBetween() is more precise than the smaller and logically identical qBetween2() function that utilizes a more straight forward AxisAngle2WQuaternion() == aa2q()\nqBetween() catches more div0 cases and defers divisions (by small numbers) as much as possible.\nYou just lose a lot of precision by naively doing AngleBetween(vec3 a,vec3 b){;return acos(dot(a,b)/(length(a)*length(b)));}\nand AngleBetween() more liklely divides by (something close to) 0.\n\nNo matter how you construct a quaternion for a rotation, at its core you have an 1/arcos() normalization by the angleBetween 2 vec3.\nhttps://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/realNormedAlgebra/quaternions/index.htm\nat their core, quaternions are complex numbers, and non-normalized quaternions have other uses (than rotating a vec3).\n\nquaternions are ALWAYS more efficient when you have forward kinematics, because it just multiplies many normalized vec4(), instead of multiplying as many mat3.\ndoing an q/dot(q,q) squared-normalization every 4 quaternion multiplications is OPTIONAL, to adjust for acumulating precision errors.\n(when lenght(a) is close to 1, you can to a/dot(a,a) instead of a/lenght(a)==normalize(a) to re-normalize(), qich skips 1 (inverse)sqrt() for 1 division)\n\nall the above does not include\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp#Quaternion_Slerp\nJonathanBlow qrote a lot about rotations for game engines, and has some fast slerp approximations (most are already on shadertoy (only in 2d)):\nhttp://number-none.com/product/Hacking%20Quaternions/\nhttp://number-none.com/product/Understanding%20Slerp,%20Then%20Not%20Using%20It/",

For my example, I just hacked something in, which in the context of this example would be something like the following:\n#if 1\nfloat d = length(max(abs(r - vec2(.17, 0)) - tr*vec2(.044, -.003 + .044*y), 0.));\nd = mix(d, length(r - vec2(.17, 0)) - .03, .25); // Or preferably, something better.\n#else // Etc.\n\nHowever, I'd imagine using an elliptical bound, or something like that, would be more efficient.\n\nIn regard to polyhedra, it's not really my area either. However, a lot of the most interesting imagery associated with the subject tends to involve a simple icosahedron and its dual, the dodecahedron, each of which I'm sure you're familiar with. Essentially, working with the objects involves the same process: Produce the object, identify the local face position, vertices, edge midpoints, etc, then take it from there.",

That distributes the teeth contacts uniformly across all possible tooth pairs, which in turn ensures that the erosion that happens over years of usage gets also distributed evenly, so the gears get working as smoothly as possible for the longest time. For example, in these steam machines, this gear has 13 teeth and this other one has 31.",

I'll just chime in and mention (because I have professionally written code to produce engineering-accurate gear splines) that the \"proper and correct\" tooth shape is known as an involute curve. For gears it's the curve formed by a point moving along a rotating line which is tangent to a circle. This produces contact points between the teeth with parallel surface normals, so friction is applied uniformly (and the gears don't intersect or miss each other). See here. In my work I approximated the curve with a bezier.\n\nThe shader is awesome anyway and the synth code is really nice and simple. I just thought I'd point out some info on real gears for anyone interested.",

So normally I start with the brute-force implementation, and then start extracting all the symmetries I see one at a time and stop when I cannot think of any more, rather than when I understand the properties of my tiling and know I have exhausted all opportunities.

I love the rendering style -- It has a steampunk vibe to it.\n\nI put one of these together a while back, then got curious as to the simplest arrangement that would allow three or more interlocking gears. The one I went with was a G(3, 0) icosahedral Goldberg arrangement, but for all I know, there might be better ones. I took a space folding approach, which drastically cut down on rendering, but never explored whether it was an option for the...  rhombicuboctahedron (I think) arrangement here. \n\nBy the way, I remember getting the gears to interlock a little more by tapering the gear and teeth radii according to the spherical depth, but using cones to set a maximum bound would probably work better.",

And I guessed that Pressure = up+down+right+left and that velocity = (right-left , up-down). Advection is the same as always - step w/ the velocity (in this case calculated from u/d/l/r. Pressure exchange I guessed was just exchanged on each boundary with the corresponding internal direction : left-boundary: right energy enters from left etc. acceleration is always the gradient of pressure, but acceleration increases the difference between antiparallel energies - which is the calculation for velocity. \n\nSo I totally guessed at how to do it based on my experience - idk if it corresponds to other algorithms... I just kind of intuitively put the pieces together until it looked right. \n\nBut it doesn't correspond to MeAndMyNeighborhood other than the advection step. But the feeling behind it is totally the same.  Translation, Free Energy exchange, Acceleration=grad(Pressure)\n\nThere are some things that I can do with this algorithm that I cannot do with the other. For example, on line 32 in Buffer A, I slowly mix the distribution values with the calculated pressure - which is like internal viscosity or something? idk I was just messing around, but that's like a weird thing I couldn't do before by tracking velocity and pressure separately. \n\nSo by defining Lattice Boltzmann as a fluid algorithm that uses distribution values instead of velocity and pressure, this totally is, but if you're comparing it to something other people have done... well in that case I have no clue.",

In bufferA change line 31 coefficient from 0.0005 to 0.001 (I believe this is the Lattice Boltzmann tau coefficient, but can't be sure since it isn't documented), things will be much faster, then try to change it to 0.01, you'll see your entire scene get swallowed up by reddish grey, and when you try to lower the number again, your paint will be swallowed, this is NaN propogation, which is hard to handle and very easy.",

When you remove that section, or change it to \"#if 0\", the jelly cloth starts falling freely. Personally, I like to use \"if (false) /*newline*/{...}\", because it doesn't use the pre-processor and you can easily enable/disable the code by commenting out the line containing \"if (false)\", or make it dynamic by using a variable instead of a literal.\n\nYes, this algorithm is based on verlet integration (update only uses two latest positions and acceleration). However, the cloth constraints are solved using a simple relaxation technique (move points 10% in the direction enforced by each constraint). Also note, that thanks to verlet integration, the corrections performed by the constraints implicitly change the velocity.\n\nAbout the next step, this is one of the most impressive cloth on shadertoy: curtain and ball",

The raymaching loop has in the order of a hundred \"map\" calls, whereas bump mapping tends to involve about four.\n\nYou seem to know your way around differential geometry, etc, so if you're not familiar with bump mapping (texture or function form), I'm pretty sure you'll figure it out. Either way, I have examples everywhere that are pretty easy to drop into code.\n\nIt also helps to have a bunch of cliche functions in your head that are cheap, but visually effective. In this case, it's also possible to store detailed terrain in a buffer, since GPUs these days tend to be pretty efficient when reading texel values. I use that technique in several shaders on here.",

Degradation tends to occur on account of the GPU based \"sin\" function's inability to handle large values - that I don't consider large at all - with enough precision. I'm not familiar with GPU construction, but I'd assume that the lab nerds would endeavor to get more accuracy out of each new generation?\n\nEither way, if you look at the smooth 2D value noise function, \"n2D,\" you'll see that I really went overboard trying to group operations together in order to minimize instruction count, which meant rolling in the \"sin\" based hash function. I could definitely get increased accuracy using Dave Hoskins's \"sin\" free hash, but it might sacrifice a bit of speed... Shading makes my head hurt sometimes.",

As an exercise, I tried to make a Lipschitz friendly (for want of a better description) terrain with a tunnel running through it. I think I managed to do it, but the second I started smoothing things, adding interesting features, etc - which tends be aesthetically necessary - things would break down.

In regard to anticipating the pitch ahead of time, sometimes that can cause trouble when the sinusoidal path frequency is too high, so I've left that as is. Either way, I could probably add one or two layers of terrain noise to the camera motion to give the impression that more of the underlying terrain is being anticipated.\n\nOn a side note, moving a camera along a path only adds a few lines here and there, so I'm surprised that more people don't apply it.\n\n@antonOTI\nThat scenery is pretty freaky.

The \"abs(d)<.001*(1. + t*const)\" was my particular tweak, and I've used it on various examples for years. I didn't use it here because I didn't want to confuse matters beyond necessary. Also, tweaks along those lines can sometimes effect reflections, depending on the situation.\n\nSome of my examples were written years ago, and were sometimes based on code written years before that. Reflections, even five years ago (almost to the day) could really slow things down, and there were so many weird things that could ruin performance. These days, I'd probably recommend some of my later reflection examples as templates, since GPUs can handle nesting and branching much better. In fact, come to think of it, I might put up a 2020 version... Actually, nothing in 2020 has turned out good, so I might wait until 2021.",

However, the reason I stuck to just two passes for this particular example was for reasons, as you mentioned, noise.\n\nAs for the temporal filter, this has the cheapest one available, a swiftly moving camera.  Seriously, though, the still-frame antialiasing you see when you hit pause is always a little on the disappointing side. You'll also notice that more shadow iterations (only 16 are used) are necessary.\n\nI've seen people apply a single-pass, geometric, edge filter, then take out the noise in the hot spots. It kind of works, and it's definitely faster than antialiasing the whole thing, but it's still not quite the same.",

        "ollj, 2017-11-09i am in favor of video games using CSG raymarching.but it limits the games fps/resolution a lot.\nFor now this is mostly used for occlusion (better shadows), like in the latest Unrea-lEngine.because you can easily scale that, make it coarse, without looking very different.\n\nOr it is used for deferred shading to compose mesh agents with a fractal sets (there is a unity 5 plugin for that, its all japanese because it is based in the MMD scene). his constrains complexity by using it only a little bit, very contained and occluded by simpler older methods.\n\nIn the end (besides these above 2) i see this method work in 2 more contexts:\n\n- Backgrounds similar to the backgrounds of the game Mother2, especially its battle-encounter background animations. This likely ends up as a game that can do good visuals (with surreal isometric tiles), but still focuses its memory and processing power on good music instead. As a result it ages better with time than the Nth reboot of CoD or Fifa.\n\n- Using a comic book style as framing, and only animate one window of a comic book at a time, most of the time. this shifts focus and lowers resolution, and you can easily zoom out while fps get too low, without breaking the framing device.\nSee the intro to the most recent ducktales-series-reboot for a style reference, but imagine it as interactive media. Disregard any 4th wall of the framing context (even more than this on interactive media where an agent jumps out of the comic book frame) , because its interactive anyways.",

You can do the same lighting effects. In fact, many raymarching shaders here in Shadertoy implement shadows (XsX3DB), ambient occlusion (lsX3DH), reflections (MdlGzn), refraction (lsXGzH), subsurface scattering (4dsGRl), motion blur (4slGzl), or global illumination (ldsGWB)",

My understanding is you just treat this as flattening the integral for a single light source.\n\nSo the trivial way to handle multiple lights would be to pick a light (via some CDF) first, then use a second random variable to pick along the ray for this light using equi-angular sampling.\n\nIf you have a lot of overlapping lights, you will probably get better results by multiple importance sampling between equi-angular sampling for all lights to combine all the pdfs.\n\nAs noted in the paper, if you have dense (usually meaning non-homogenous) media, you also get better results by still partly sampling using the scattering function alone (and of course use multiple importance sampling to combine with equi-angular sampling).",

I noticed that isolating the fresnel term returns the environment specular color. I modified the code to return fresnel term and was surprised to notice that I see only a solid base color instead of brightening of the base color along the edges of the geometry where the ndotv vectors approaches 0. When calculating the fresnel term with ndotv I see more of what I'd expect, which I see is an input into EnvBRDFApprox. \n\nAll this to ask why is fresnel calculated with ldoth or vdoth instead of ndotv or ndoth?",

Glyphs may share the same subroutines, enveloped by transformations. Glyphs can be composed of smaller tesselated sub-glyphs. Glyphs may be defined as array of smaller sub-glyphs in a tesselation that is smaller than a glyph. 2 different glyphs may or may not share the same sub-tesselation. it may make sense to rotate a sub-tesselatio for glyphs with more diagonal lines.\nif a glyph is defined as array on a tesselation, it can modulo-shift on a grid that is smaller than the glyph.\n\nyou may chose to use multiple overlapping tesselations for seamless offsets or multy-layers, but this usually makes things less efficient. it makes more sense if one tesselation is scaled or offset differently from another tesselation:\n[url=https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xt23zG]4 offset ovrlapping tesselations[url]\n\nit is \"relatively\" easy to define non univorm tiles quadtree) without overlap for traversal or typesetting: the context of defining tand addressing them for typesetting may be tricky and novel extension to https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xs2czK\n\ntreat any glyph as a combining character on tiles where tiles to not overlap, but may have sub-tiles and transformations.\n\nYou then can tread a text as a glyph that is composed of an array of glyphs.",

All this is not necessarily bad though, its only risky if done so much that the compiler stack heap collides. and it can  increases compile time a bit\n.\nUnrolling loops (or otherwise transforming them) and using LUTs is the less memory efficient but faster run-time approach. It is being done 100% automatically since the early 90s. before that , loop optimization was a much more manual and explicit thing, and it was treasured for performance when you used sequences of modulo to reduce dome break or end conditions, calculating in bulks instead (early parallel/vector processing).\nA #define likely outperforms an equivalent function on run-time. because the processor more likely finds optimizations that can often be obfuscated by subroutines, or slowed down by branches and changing pointers. opengl is  lot about constructing and executing these 16x16 matrices doing multiple transformations in one cycle. this benefits from #define and loop unrolling.\n\nusing determinant() likely increases compile time and runtime. it is a  matrix multiplication optimized vector processor after all.",

        "blackjero, 2017-09-20Thanks iq, yes sorry it is a bit more complicated looking than it should...\n\nModeling: the trench is a U shape with 2 infinite greebled planes evaluations added, one for the top ground plane and one for the 2 (symmetric) vertical walls.\n\nTiles are inspired by the shape grammar split encountered years ago in \"Procedural Modeling of Buildings\", but a lot of people who do generative art do that naturally I think. For hardcoding things a bit I chose to only work with split patterns that lead to 4 children (ascii art in comment), and do at most 1 recursion. I split each root tile (COLOR_TILES to visualize) into 4 subregions, then pick at most 2 children, and split those into 4, then stop. It's just a tedious mini kdtree of some kind... Space is distorted with linear steps in some places to get some diagonal patterns + some randomized 90degrees rotations for variation.\n\nThere is a bit of extra obfuscating code for optimizing the marching with a bit of raytracing...",

So it's like using the noise result as a y offset on a plane using f(x,z) = y or consider that as g(x,y,z) = y- f(x,z) = 0. \nMy main problem is when I want to create some noise based bump on any object's surface, I want a 3d noise on a varying 2d surface. I came out with this formula that seems to work normalize(-e.xyz - (dot(-e.xyz,n)-1.0)*n), where n is the point's surface normal and e the partial derivatives vector. It works on any continuous surface object but not on a cube for example.\n\nBut in this example I really fail to understand what the 3d noise result is actually doing. Is it telling if after a certain level of noise the point is actually filled with matter or not, or is is displacing some surface point on a certain direction? From the normal calculation I would say it's the first solution, but I'm not so sure.",

(i.e. each of these R/G/B ray will bounce in the diamond until it quits and eventually reaches the cubemap) The code would essentially be the same except that the raycast function would take a specific refraction index in argument, and return a scalar value instead of a vec3 (= intensity of the channel, not a color)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I'll maybe try that when I'll get access to a computer .",

I like the overall design.\n\nSometimes, if I have a few materials to sort through, I'll save the individual object distances in a global container (vec4, mat4, array, etc) inside the map function without sorting, then sort them outside the loop. However, GPUs are strange creatures, so I can never be sure whether it's a faster method or not. I'd imagine taking the \"else if\" statements outside the main loop would help with things like compiling, and so forth, but who knows. Either way, this easily runs at 60 FPS on my machine, so I guess it's a moot point. \n\nAs for the blood, it'd be interesting to see what an extra reflective\\refractive pass would do, but as you mentioned, you were looking to keep things simple, and that'd definitely complicate things.",

Anyway, really like your racing concept shaders, and I am building a AR hardware I call it Sand Reality, I want to make a car racing scene on it <a href=\"https://github.com/BoxWorld/SandRealityShaders/blob/master/Racing.stoy\"  class=\"regular\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> but not doing good.

I don't know if it's intentional in order to show dark and light, but I managed to fix it by adjusting in mainImage after #ifdef BOTH, line 196:   d = uv.x < 0.5 ? abs(d)+0.07 : d;\nto either ... uv.x< 0.1 or lower (or so, the line moved to the left) or: d = uv.x < 1.0 ? abs(d)+0.07 : d; \nThe line is removed \"to the right\".",

Of course, the isolines become more prominent. Reducing the \"thD\" variable, tweaking the final loop line, increasing iterations, etc, makes things more concise, but at the expense of framerate.\n\nYou could also swap in a more forgiving distance field equation, etc, but I wanted to continue with Fabrice's repeat cube theme. By the way, replacing it with a Menger Cube, metaballs, etc, is pretty interesting.\n\nBy the way, I haven't tried it on this particular example, but it might look nicer using the weighted distribution thing, a la Cloudy Spikeball - and some of IQ's texture-based examples.

At the time, raymarching 3D Voronoi wasn't viable, so I was obsessed with coming up with an alternative. I later went to the trouble of packing real 3D Voronoi into a 2D texture for a comparison. The real thing is better, but this is a way, way faster.\n\nAnyway, the rest was an afterthought, including the rendering style. Out of sheer boredom, I put up a \"Glowing Blocks\" example the other day and noted that it had a halfway decent heated surface look about it for very little extra cost. I think between that, this and few other things, it'd be possible to make a cheap, but nice molten rock example... Of course, if you want something really nice looking, then Virgil's \"Rhodium Liquid Carbon\" example would be the one to look at.",

The tile here uses just six strategically placed spheres, and under certain circumstances, you can get away with as few as four. Of course, you're not limited to just spheres.\n\nI know of a few ways to take the method further, but I'd be more interested in seeing your take on it.",

The ones that need it, can do it on their own, although it is very painful indeed, which is bad for the shader artists/creators.\n\nSo I think we should work on adding the ever wanted buffer controls to passes. These should be per pass, not per shader (again, a pass might need restart on resize, other passes on the same shader shouldn't). Other pass/buffer controls include frequency of refresh (once, on resize, every frame, every N frames, etc). A second iteration on that would be per buffer/pass pixel format options (unorm8 vs int v f16 v f32). And a third one would be custom resolution for each buffer/pass.\n\nWe've been a slow on implementing many of these features, but we should be able to put them up the priority list.",

It is a shame that raymarching, and shader-writing in general, seems to be a rather small niche of the programming world. It embodies the beauty of maths so well.\nA lot of your approaches integrate optimisation so heavily that I am struggling to read the logic in the code, as I am not that good at visualising mod functions yet. I can understand \"iteratively subtract the cross\" - I have made fractals before, but I do not understand how \n...\n      vec3 a = mod( p*s, 2.0 )-1.0;\n      s *= 3.0;\n      vec3 r = 1.0 - 3.0*abs(a);\n...\n     d = max(d,c);\n\nachieves the iterative subtraction of the crosses... I get why individual numbers are there - the 3 scales the cross as it gets smaller, the \"1.0-\" moves it into the middle of the next smaller grid. But if I try to derive these ideas from scratch myself my code does not produce what I want it to...",

I was thinking the other day that Shadertoy easily has enough inventory these days to have a \"Shader Of The Day\", but I'm guessing preparing the front page every day would get tiresome for the creators pretty quickly -- I wouldn't want to do it. \n\nAnyway, this example was a half hearted attempt to create imagery with a Blender rendered feel. I haven't done it in a while, but I watch the occasional Blender tutorial. I'm always amazed by the sheer amount of work their artists put in, and how lazy my efforts look by comparison.  It's a bit hard to compete with a huge engine with endless assets and the luxury of rendering time, but I noticed a lot of effects rely heavily on simple postprocessing algorithms, so I figured I could at least put more effort into that.\n\n@Kali\nIf it were up to me, I'd be puting your recent \"Swirled\" shader on the front page.",

The name was just a place holder that I never bothered to change, but the example does contain a cliche refraction-reflection loop, so I'll leave it as is for now. I have some interesting bendy light examples that I'll eventually get around to posting.\n\nI definitely prefer the refraction, DOF, etc, logic contained in path tracers. I tend to make post-processing DOF blur logic up as I go. Sometimes, I might want less blur falloff near the camera and more toward the horizon, etc. What I'd really like to see is a nice compact bokeh function without needing to stitch together several tabs.

The real life objects are usually done up with lights and so forth to make some really cool imagery, and I'd like to make one of those later.\n\nIn regard to the surfaces that let light through in one direction, but not the other, I've never looked into it -- It was probably mentioned during one of my classes when I was staring out the window thinking about anything other than math and physics.

I use the actual pixel size, you used a magic number 0.03 or something, I've got rid of most of the branches with clamps but anyway....\n\nThis is a nice shader. I like the brown color did you look at my toroids shader?\n\nAnyway. Its kind of ironic as I did the cards shader as a demo to get a job and you COMPLETELY rewrote it.

        "ZigguratVertigo, 2015-09-02Yup, \"detail normal mapping\" is the process of adding detail to an existing normal map, often to enhance the visual quality, break apart repeating patterns, change the look of a surface, etc. \n\nIn the example above, the base surface is a cambered disk that rests on a flat background, stored in tangent space. We then generate a detail normal map from one of the provided images on Shadertoy using a high-pass filter. In a typical gamedev scenario, artists would provide these maps in textures. We then combine both normals using Reoriented Normal Mapping, as well as other commonly-used techniques. \n\nThe goal behind this little demo is to demonstrate that several well-accepted techniques by the art community are actually quite wrong, and should not be used. This is especially true for the well-known Overlay approach or \"just add them and normalize, I tell you it works\" approaches to combining normal maps that you can find on several art forums. Hopefully one day the old approaches will be forgotten, and all those faulty normal map blending tutorials one can find on the Internet will vanish. ;)\n\nReoriented Normal Mapping (RNM) involves rotating (or reorienting) the detail normal map so that it follows the \"surface\" of the base normal map, just as tangent-space normals are transformed by the underlying geometry when lighting in object or world space. We chose quaternions because they allow to easily represent the unique rotation from one vector to another (here, between the reference normal [0,0,1] and the base normal), via the shortest arc. Once this quaternion is defined, we can easily transform the detail normal and get the resulting (reoriented) normal. \n\nPlease check out our paper if you want to see how the quaternion math was simplified (here: http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/blending-in-detail/)",

It makes a lot of sense and the results are very nice as seen here.",

This one marches through cell IDs instead of physical space - it finds intersections from the ray origin each time instead of accumulating cell positions as a moving cursors (if I understand well) - so that could bring extra stability for long rays perhaps? Also this one precomputes the dot products of the ray direction and the face normals, since those are constant during all the traversal (and their inverse, so only a mul is needed per iteration).\n\nBut conceptually both implementations they seem to work on the same principle, not surprisingly, this is just how one traverses square grids as well: 4dSGW1.

Similar to this shader where I to grid traversal and raymarching inside each cell. Hexagons are a better way to evenly partition space than squares (closer to a circle).

        "P_Malin, 2019-09-19Thanks alro.\nWhen I say \"clipping\", I just mean that any color values output to the final screen buffer will get \"clipped\" when they are greater than one. Color values greater than one don't make sense for this kind of color space for output to a monitor so in the GPU hardware it is like there is a final piece of shader code that says:\nif ( fragColor.r > 1.0f ) fragColor.r = 1.0f;\nif ( fragColor.g > 1.0f ) fragColor.g = 1.0f;\nif ( fragColor.b > 1.0f ) fragColor.b = 1.0f;\nThis can have a number of different terms like, clamping, clipping, or saturating.\nIn HLSL the instruction saturate (which is often free) limits values to be between 0.0f and 1.0f inclusive.\n\nClipping generally is about keeping sections of an input that lie within a particular region (like clipping a line or polygon primitive to just keep the region that is onscreen). Here I'm using the term to describe color clipping - keeping the range of color values that are valid to send to the display.\n\nThe clipping that was happening when a color reached 1.0 was making a sudden jump or discontinuity when there was a transition from a smoothly increasing gradient to a constant value. The code change I added makes it so that the initial slope for dark values near zero is the same as it was previously but then as values get bigger they taper off so bigger and bigger numbers all the way up to infinity get squashed into a smaller range and the output never quite reaches one.",

        "P_Malin, 2019-09-12Hi Alro,\nApologies if you don't want feedback \n\nIts a stylistic thing but currently you clip the individual r,g,b color values. This produces the \"rings\" in the image as the red channel will clamp first, then green, then blue and these discontinuities in the gradient are visible. \nIts a complicated topic but one option here when you have input values > 1.0 is to apply a tonemap function with a shoulder so that these dont 'clip' when they reach 1.0.\n\ne.g. you can add this line, in this case perhaps just before the final fragColor = line in your shader:\ncol = 1.0 - exp( -col );\n\nI made a graph to illustrate: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f14x5a9lsb\n\nThis has a similar effect to remove the clipping in your \"GLOWING WAVES\" shader too.\n\nI think the glow looks cool without this change by the way, I'm just throwing the idea out there.",

        "MinimilisticBits, 2023-06-13To ath500\nI'm glad to see that my code has been analyzed and appreciated for its advanced techniques in GLSL. Developing this shader was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on the insights provided.\n\n    Fractal geometry: Yes, fractal generation is a key focus of my code. I'm deeply fascinated by the intricate patterns and structures that can be created through iterative algorithms. I wanted to explore various types of fractals and experiment with different techniques to achieve visually captivating results. It's great to see that the complexity and diversity of my fractal generation methods have been acknowledged.\n\n    Noise and hash functions: I integrated a hash function and a random noise generator to introduce randomness into the fractal generation process. These functions are indeed widely used in procedural generation and were crucial for adding complexity and variability to the generated fractals. They help create a more organic and natural appearance in the final output.\n\n    Blurring effects: Implementing blurring effects was essential to enhance the visual quality of the shader. By applying convolution operations and sampling neighboring pixels, I aimed to achieve smooth transitions and soften the details in the image. This technique allowed me to create a more aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing result.\n\n    Color Correction: I'm glad that the use of the ACES Filmic Tone Mapping curve for color correction was recognized. I wanted to achieve a more realistic and cinematic color reproduction, and this technique was instrumental in achieving that goal. The curve parameters were carefully selected to produce the desired aesthetic, and they can be tweaked to adapt to different use cases or artistic preferences.\n\n    Performance considerations: Indeed, real-time rendering performance was a significant factor in designing the code. By utilizing loops with a constant number of iterations, I ensured that the time complexity remained low and the shader could render efficiently. However, I am aware that as the complexity of the fractals or scenes increases, there is a possibility of visual artifacts or incomplete renderings. In future iterations, I will explore dynamic loop limits to address these potential issues and enhance the rendering capabilities.\n\nI appreciate the feedback regarding code organization and clarity. While I aimed to create a visually stunning shader, I understand the importance of making the code more understandable for others. Your suggestions for increased commentary, including explanations of the mathematical principles, descriptions of function purposes, and clear identification of experimental sections, are valuable. I will definitely consider these improvements to make the code more accessible and easier to comprehend.\n\nThank you for taking the time to analyze my code and provide such insightful feedback. It's encouraging to know that my efforts in leveraging GLSL and mathematical principles in computer graphics have been recognized. I'll continue to refine my skills and explore new possibilities in shader development.",

        "ath500, 2023-06-08It's clear that the author of this code is using a combination of advanced techniques in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which includes procedural noise generation, blurring, and color correction, to produce some visually interesting results. Here are some insights that can be drawn from the provided code:\n\n1. **Fractal geometry:** A significant part of the code is dedicated to fractal generation, specifically 3D fractals. The methods `jb`, `jb2`, `jb3`, `DEmine`, `de22`, `DEeerr`, `newde`, `fractal`, `fractal_de46` and a few others generate fractal-based distance estimations using a variety of iterative techniques. It's also noteworthy that the author is experimenting with various fractal types and techniques.\n\n2. **Noise and hash functions:** The author uses a hash function `wang_hash` and a random noise generator `rndf` in the fractal generation process, which are commonly used in procedural generation for producing randomness.\n\n3. **Blurring effects:** The `blur` and `blur2` functions implement a sort of convolution operation to produce a blur effect, sampling surrounding pixels and applying weights to them. It's an effective technique to create smooth transitions and soften the details in the image.\n\n4. **Color Correction:** The `ACESFilm` function appears to implement a color correction using the ACES Filmic Tone Mapping curve. This technique is often used in games and films to achieve a more realistic or cinematic color reproduction. It's important to mention that the curve parameters (a, b, c, d, and e) are typically chosen to produce the desired aesthetic and may be tweaked to fit the specific use-case.\n\n5. **Performance considerations:** The loops in fractal calculation functions have a constant number of iterations, which means the time complexity is O(1). This helps to ensure real-time rendering performance. However, as the complexity of the fractal or scene increases, these hard-coded loop limits could lead to visual artifacts or incomplete renderings.\n\nOverall, this is a quite advanced shader demonstrating solid knowledge of both GLSL and the underlying mathematical principles used in computer graphics. Despite the complexity, the code could benefit from some refactoring and increased commentary for better understandability. The commenting could include explanations of the mathematical principles in use, descriptions of each function's purpose, and clearer identification of experimental or 'work-in-progress' sections of code.",

The shader is 43028 bytes with loop unrolling, but only 20120 bytes when forcing loops. Having bigger size is terrible, because it actually causes a lot of cache thrashing\n2. LDS is used with loop unrolling. Not sure why it's used, but using it will introduce some waits when multiple threads access the same LDS.\n3. Looks like forcing a loop increases the scalar ALU, so maybe some operator become scalar instead of vector? Very hard to say for sure though.\nunroll:\nScalar ALU:           318\nVector ALU:           7363\nforce loop:\nScalar ALU:           327\nVector ALU:           3223\n\nI think the biggest win is the binary code size, which makes sense.",

Also, the recent Vulkan-based compilers react very differently (sometime worse perfs, sometime better). \n\nDetail: for the first minute or so the perfs oscillate really a lot, before stabilising at 8.6 fps at 640x360.",

That lowered the compile time from 4 seconds to 1 for me. On the other hand I'm not sure why that improves performance, but it does. All I can hypothesize is that perhaps there's a code cache in the GPU to speed up instruction fetching and loops help keep the relevant code in the cache for a longer time? Regardless, it helped with a 40% speedup in my GPU. I used that extra performance to tweak the visuals and make the shader look better, while still leaving a 1.2x overall performance improvement.

Sometimes it stretches even more, and gets buggy, but that's rare enough. Take a square in the 2D texture, say 64x64. Find the 3D position of a texel in the middle of it to place the bounding sphere. The radius has to be big enough to cover the maximum length the patch of cloth can extend. That is sqrt(1^2+1^2) * 64 / 2.0 * maxstretch. If the ray misses this sphere, you can skip the whole 2D rectangle. The hiararchy must be implemented without any form of recursion to make it compilable, but it simulates a recursive quad tree.",

You are approximating each vertex by a disk/sphere (and oversampling it 8x to make them small enough that they become subpixel size). You have all the vertices in a 2D texture, and you are traversing it in 2D to find ray-sphere intersections. You start from texel 0,0, then move overt it finding intersections with spheres of of bigger and smaller radius based on the level in the hierarchy, but I don't see how these spheres bound more vertices. Basically, I'm missing the 2D to 3D relationship. Any explanation would be great!!",

The problem is (probably) that I use texelFetch without any form of interpolation for the 3D lookup (line 107 in buffer C - to keep the shader a bit fast). If I could precompute 3D buffers I would use a linear lookup (and mipmaps).\n\nI've added mouse-control to look around. Enjoy",

I guess the idea is that you won't notices inaccuracies as you travel further afield. Under the right circumstances, it can speed up traversal noticeably. On a side note, I'll sometimes use a distance-based variable bump mapping-factor as well.",

I think the best way to understand this would be to ignore the whole thing, then create a black and white 2D shader with an inner ring and an outer ring separated by spokes.\n\nI said, \"Comment this out...,\" when I should have said, \"Change this to 'p = abs(p)...'.\" Anyone who's ever read a text book at school knows that authors make a lot of typos, conceptual errors, etc.",

I am not a savant who knows a matrices rotation by looking at it!\nany rotation in 3d comes down to AxisAngle, you translate points around an axis by an angle (in radians)\nAn axisAngle rotation is a vec4\nit translates to a mat3 rotation matrix (and back).\nAs usual, multiplying 2 rotation matrices returns a rotation matrix that is identical to applying the 2 matrices in the same order.\nthis is non-commutative, order matters just as it does when you divide.\n---\na camera() function can be defined by 3 point parameters:  position, target, up-direction.\nmost simple (shadertoy) camera functions use these parameters (and fragment.xy), \nbecause they are intuitive and simple functions to return RayDirection (and RayPosition).\n\nThat RayDirection is then multiplied|rotated by the rotation matrix that you get from the methods below:\n---\ninterruption:\nThere are other \"camera()\" functions that take (position and an AxisAngle rotation (and fragment.xy)) as parameters to orient the camera to rotate a camera by an angle around an axis.\nbut these are less intuitive, less modifiable, more elegant, and require more knowledge about rotations in 3d.\nsuch functions directly take your rotation as axisAngle. their internal rotation basically adds one more rotation to the cameras orientation, set by fragment.xy\nyou may notice that you can build such a camera() function by understanding \"matrix rotation solution\"\n---\nto get a rotation (composed of a sum of rotations) to rotate a point by it....:\n\nmatrix rotation solution (better|easier for summing <4 rotations)\n- 1st: convert AxisAngle rotation to mat3 rotation matrix\n- 2nd: matrix multiplications to merge rotations\n- 3rd: multiply vector with merged rotation matrix to translate a point to its rotated point\n\nquaternion rotation solution (better for summing >3 rotations)\n- 1st: \"Converting the AxisAngle rotation into a quaternion\"\n- 2nd: quaternion multiplications (the quaternion equivalent to matrix multiplication)\n   ... quaternion multiplication is only half as complex as matrix multiplication\n- 3rd: apply quaternion to translate a point to its rotated position: \n   ... converting the quaternion to a rotation matrix should be fastest on GPUs. \n   ... but there are 2 different approaches without matrices.\n   ... It basically adds a bit of complexity that the \"matrix rotation solution\" does not have.\n---- \nwhy quaternions:\nmax3*mat3 multiplication is 9* dot().\nquaternion*quaternion is almost only half as many multiplications and additions and functionally identical, just represented differently.\nbeware tat quaternions, by storing the same rotations with less values, more quickly accumulate rounding errors.\n\nfor newer GPUS not using quaternions can easily calculate just as fast as not using them.\nbut using quaternions in long kinematic chains is definitely less computationally complex, likely saving energy, likely keeping a gui cooler.\n\nyour shadertoy code likely does not need quaternion functions, because it rarely sums more than 3 rotations,where matrix is faster and more precise.\nbut if you do add more than 3 rotations, the quaternion code below is likely faster:\n//of course it is also bulkier in source code than just multiplying matrices.\n----------------------------------\n//quaternion functions are untested and could contains typos:\n\n//return quaternion of normalized(!) axisAngle: a.xyz=axis a.w=angle\nvec4 aaToQuat(vec4 a){return vec4(a.xyz*sin(a.w*.5),cos(a.w*.5));}\n  \n//return quaternion of axisAngle (after normalizing Axis): a.xyz=axis a.w=angle\nvec4 aaToQuatN(vec4 a){return aaToQuat(vec3(a.xyz/length(a.xyz),a.w));}\n \n//quaternion normalize\nvec4 quatNorm(vec4 q){return q/length(q);}\n//quaternion multiplications tend to lose accuracy, you chose how often you normalize them.\n//normalizing of course adds rounding errors.\n\n//get conjugate quaternion\nvec4 conjugate(Quat4d q){vec4 r=q; r.xyz=-q.xyz;return r;}\n\n//transform|rotate point p by quaternion q, \"like\" an axis angle rotation with axis trough (0,0)\nvec3 QuatTrans(vec3 p,vec4 q){float x=q.x;float y=q.y; float z=q.z; float w=q.w;//shortcuts\n //return vec3(\n //   w*w*p.x+2.*y*w*p.z-2*z*w*p.y+   x*x*p.x+2.*y*x*p.y+2.*z*x*p.z-   z*z*p.x-y*y*p.x,\n //2.*x*y*p.x+   y*y*p.y+2*z*y*p.z+2.*w*z*p.x-   z*z*p.y+   w*w*p.y-2.*x*w*p.z-x*x*p.y,\n //2.*x*z*p.x+2.*y*z*p.y+  z*z*p.z-2.*w*y*p.x-   y*y*p.z+2.*w*x*p.y-   x*x*p.z+w*w*p.z);\n //above function likely performs slower on GPUs than below function:\n return p1*QuatToMat3(q);}\n\n//a (likely faster on gpu) method is to transform the quaternion to its matrix form:\n\n//return mat3 transformation matrix of quaternion q, \"like\" an axis angle rotation with axis trough (0,0)\nmat3 QuatToMat3(vec4 q){return mat3(vec3 s=q.xyz*w.xyz*2.;\n vec3 x=2.*vec3(q.x*q.y,q.x*q.z,q.x*q.w);vec3 w=2.*vec3(q.y*q.z,q.y*q.w,q.z*q.w);\n //i am not too sure if buffering all these values in 2 vec3 makes it faster.\n return mat3(1.-s.y-s.z,   x.x-w.z,x.y+w.y,\n                x.x+w.z,1.-s.x-s.z,w.x-x.z,\n                x.y-w.y,   w.x+x,z,1.-s.x-s.y);}\n//there are different approaches to this identity:\n//see http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/conversions/quaternionToMatrix/index.htm\n\nfloat maf(float a,float b, float c){return fmad(a,b,c);//less percision, more speed\n//return mad(a,b,c);//explicit mad(), because we do not trust the compiler to be smart!\nreturn a*b+c;}//let it be implicit, but with explicit order!\n//explicit \"mad()\" or fmad()\n\n//quaternion multiplication is not commutative\nquatMul(vec4 q1,vec4 q2){return vec4(\n maf(q1.x,q2.w,(q1.y*q2.z))-maf(q1.z,q2.y,(q1.w*q2.x)),\n maf(q1.y,q2.w,(q1.z*q2.x))-maf(q1.x,q2.z,(q1.w*q2.y)),\n maf(q1.x,q2.y,(q1.z*q2.w))-maf(q1.y,q2.x,(q1.w*q2.z)),\n -q1.x*q2.x-q1.y*q2.y      -maf(q1.z,q2.z,(q1.w*q2.w)));\n //above should be identical to code below:\n // q1.x*q2.w+q1.y*q2.z-q1.z*q2.y+q1.w*q2.x,\n //-q1.x*q2.z+q1.y*q2.w+q1.z*q2.x+q1.w*q2.y,\n // q1.x*q2.y-q1.y*q2.x+q1.z*q2.w+q1.w*q2.z,\n //-q1.x*q2.x-q1.y*q2.y-q1.z*q2.z+q1.w*q2.w)\n ;}//product of 2 quaternion rotations is identical of 2 rotations being executed one after another.\n//this often accumulates rounding errors to a point were you need to normalize the quaternion a lot!\n---\nexerpt:\n\"second life\" uses quaternions for anything. it doesn't have a vec4 type, it just has vec3 and \"quaternion\", force feeding you quaternion rotation and converting Euler- to quaternion-rotation.\n\"second life\" wikis and open-source scripts have some interesting solutions for quaternion questions\nsuch as \"why the hell does this plane rotate completely randomly\"",

Do you have any paper or book to advise to implement the physics of resting convex objects (at least cubes  ??. I already read the Eberly and the Millington books (I mean I REALLY read them) and wrote a lot of code, but I got stuck on the problem of the resting objects. The Millington lacks of explanations of the algorithm while the Eberly model it as a Quadratic Programming problem that is difficult to implements. Moreover, the Eberly only consider the object linear motion in collision detection and that simply does not work in my opinion (for sure I'm wrong, but I can see why).

Here, 1e4 is the escape radius for z and log2 corresponds to the squaring in each step as in the standard mandelbrot and julia sets:\n\n// texture mapping\nfloat tu = mod(atan(z.y, z.x)/6.283185, 1.);\nfloat tv = 1. - log2(log(dot(z,z))/log(1e4));\nfragColor = texture2D(iChannel0, vec2(tu,tv));\n\nSmooth color grading is just a special case of tessellation, where the texture is simple, but continued over multiple tiles/iterations. So you may find an appropriate tessellation/grading for you fractal. Extra points for an image spreaded over multiple tiles or in the ultimate setting: a single image on the whole green potential, distorted by a moving julia set for example.",

        "kev7774, 2017-01-06Another thing I found is that the the cheapstep function invented by stubbe (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ldSD2) works as a good drop-in replacement for sin (if you use the tweak I mentioned in my previous post) ,and is probably faster too.\nfloat cheapstep(float x)\n{\n    x = 1.0 - x*x;\t// MAD\n    x = 1.0 - x*x;\t// MAD\n    return x;\n}\nfloat hash12(vec2 p)\n{\n    p  = fract(p*) \n\treturn fract(cheapstep(p.x + p.y * 0.618034) * 43758.5453);\n}\n\nThe above works very well for me on my Intel iGPU. The only issue is that the output is noticeably periodic for this test case, because when any two input values of p have the same fractional part, the outputs will be the same, and the inputs happen to repeat every 125 pixels in this case (in short because your input is position(an integer) multiplied by v, which is t+1 (an integer) * .152, and the first integer multiple of .152 is .152 * 125 = 19). If you change the constant 152 on line 199 to .1727661, the periodic behavior disappears.\n\nAn alternative fix is do  \"p = fract(p*.1)\" instead of just fract(p) inside of the hash12 function. This makes the period 10x longer, and thus impossible to notice in this case.",

        "kev7774, 2017-01-06I think the reason the sine based one fails so badly on Intel is because sin has very poor precision on large arguments. Adding \"p = fract(p)\" at the beginning of hashOld12 solves the problem for me on my Intel GPU. Actually, it looks better (more random) than your hash12. But your hash12 can be improved by multiplying HASHSCALE by some number like 60 or 80. Then yours has a slight edge again.",

Although, the thought of working in collision detection makes me groan. \n\nWith regards to the rocks, I still remember that Assembly entry of yours. Any chance that you'll reproduce the underwater rock formations on Shadertoy? I hear Shadertoy will have fixed size buffers at some point, so it'll be cool being able to generate more sophisticated, tailored rock textures.",

It would have been nice to work in some extra desert-related scenery, but the framerate was an issue.\n\n@stb\nMy girlfriend walked past my screen and said it was too grainy as well. You two would probably get along. \n\nSeriously, offline, I load up WebGL textures with the anisotropic filter setting, which produces finer detail at grazing angles, minus the speckling. On Shadertoy, I've never been able to emulate the same. If you click on the iChannel1 (sandstone texture) \"cog\" icon, then change the \"Filter\" setting to \"mipmap,\" you'll get rid of the terrain speckling, but the surface will look kind of plastic. Alternatively, you could change the bump strength in the \"doBumpMap\" function, but that will smoothen things out too... I'll bet there's a way to have detail and smoothness. I just haven't figured it out yet.",

You can also use a 2D sdBezier() there for extra rendering performance, but little compile time difference unfortunately.\n\nThen I could also reduce the compile time further from 9 to 5 seconds by changing the subsurface computation by this, which looks almost the same imho and doesn't invoke the SDF: float sss = ss*0.2*clamp(0.5+0.5*dot(ld,nor),0.0,1.0)*(2.0+dot(rd,nor));\nAnd finally, the next compile-time eater is the cloth bump mapping. If I remove it (which doesn't change the look much I think?), the compile time then goes down to 3 seconds for me.\n\nAt 3 seconds compile time, which is sub 5s, the shader qualifies for Shader of the Week (the reason I explored options), but obviously needs the small changes of visuals",

The kernel is a 2D function or small matrix containing the coefficients applying to each neighborhood pixels. A Gaussian(x,y) is a very good filter (better that all coefficient = 1, which is the box filter), and it has the nice property than  Gaussian(x,y)=  Gaussian(sqrt(x\u00b2+y\u00b2)) = Gaussian(x)*Gaussian(y), so you can just filter the x values with a 1xN filter, store the result, then apply a Nx1 filter along the y.\n\nMIPmap is how textures in graphics and especially in OpenGL can allow very cheap antialiasing: the texture are already precomputed are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 .... resolution, each obtain by averaging 4 neighbor pixels. By default the \"mipmap\" flag is set in texture pannel, so that when you zoom out the texture it is automatically blurred (not-perfect, but almost free). Since this data is there, smart algorithms can take advantage to mix thin and coarse texture pixels to compute the sum.\nYou can explicitely access this data using  textureLod() instead of texture(), with extra parameter = LOD level.",

This can even take into account Gaussian profile.\n- use MIPmap (3rd texture() parameter).\n\nFrom there, you might add optimizations ;-)\nYour approach just ignore many pixels, which could cause aliasing, and there is no kernel decreasing with distance. \nFor instance you could increase the MIPmap level as you go out of center (+ decrease weight), in order to keep a hole-free coverage.",

Relatively speaking, it's a pretty short example, so making changes shouldn't be too much of a task. I usually find the most draining chore is object identification without sacrificing speed, but I'm going to start formalizing the process to make it easier.\n\n@ExNihilo\nI sometimes weave a camera in and out of grid structures. Even with a simple sinusoidal curve, it's possible to weave around as many as four columns and keep the flow whilst maintaining camera speed. I decided against it here. Not sure why. Probably to keep things simple and focus on the geometry... or I was feeling lazy.",

It's impressive to see the intricate detailing put into the geometry of the scene.\n\nThe use of the sun function creates a vivid sunset feel, with the 'bloom' effect giving a soft halo around the sun. It's interesting to see how the battery parameter is used to modulate the sun's intensity and position.\n\nThe grid effect created in the grid function is interesting, it gives the feeling of a flowing river or a shifting landscape, with the intensity again controlled by the battery parameter.\n\nYour manipulation of signed distance functions in the sdCloud function to create the clouds is artful. The clouds provide a dynamic element to the scene and are nicely detailed, using the interaction of multiple sine and cosine functions to simulate their soft, puffy appearance.\n\nThe overall image is indeed reminiscent of a serene evening at the base of Mount Fuji. The colours chosen for the final image, specifically the mix of purples, blues, and oranges, really contribute to the creation of an endearing and tranquil mood.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to perhaps add some user control - possibly through mouse input - to adjust the 'battery' level in real-time, which could make the scene more interactive.\n\nWell done on creating such an aesthetically pleasing shader!",

This can be convex and have holes.\nThe shader brute-force tests every edge and does a z-buffer like test to keep track of the closest edge that was hit (the fHitT < fClosestT condition).\nThe 'interesting' part is how the floor and ceilings work. At the start of each sector in BeginSector() it works out the floor and ceiling intersection depth and stores the resulting depth values in vSectorState.xy. As it tests each edge for the sector, if the edge's depth is greater than the floor or ceiling test it increments the value vSectorState.zw. \n\n   vSectorState.zw += step(vSectorState.xy, vec2(fHitT));\n\nBy the end of the sector (EndSector), the even-odd state of vSectorState.zw stores whether the floor/ceiling point was contained in the sector polygon or not. If it was we update the hit info, again with a z-buffer like test.\nThis is like doing a ray-casting point in polygon test http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon using the floor / ceiling intersect depth as a starting point and seeing how many edges are crossed between that depth and far clip.",

If you have a camera with a fixed shutter at 24Hz, then that's your framerate, and your motion blur should also calculate in 24Hz. But in realtime graphics, depending on a lower or higher framerate, the motion between frames can either be shorter or longer, so the effect needs to take framerate into account. Obviously, lower framerates will cause a more blurry picture, just like longer camera appertures would.",

This kernel can be calculated by applying the Jacobi solver iteration to a delta impulse (basically one white pixel on a black background). Using the previous pressure solution as an initial guess for the Jacobi pressure solver greatly enhances the solution quality in this case. The Jacobi method iteration is applying a diffusion step to the initial guess in each iteration, yielding a normal distribution as a convolution kernel. All these lines of code are just applying these two convolutions to the right-hand side of the Poisson equation and to the previous pressure solution respectively. One could probably speed things up a bit by using the separability of the Gaussian convolution of the previous pressure solution. Sidenote: Applying advection to the previous pressure solution would increase the quality of the simulation even further.",

I wanted to associate it with Voronoi, but not give the impression that it was worthy of a Voronoi replacement. Most of the hard work was done by Ken Perlin, and the geometrical aspects were probably based on the work of some mathematician before him. Either way, I'm thankful that I didn't have to start from scratch.\n\n@Nimitz\n\nLike you inferred, once you have four tetrahedral (8 cubic, etc) vertices and some kind of randomization (gradient vectors work better), you could probably do all kinds of experimentation. You can get pretty close to simplex noise by changing just a couple of things in the code above. It'd be great to see what people come up with. I know of a way to make more natural looking rocky patterns with a couple of changes.\n\nAn 8-vertex, cubic version was part of the process, but I found it involved more calculation... although, it's possible that you have a faster way of going about it than I did. I'd imagine that a surrounding tetrahedral-neighbors random-offset distance approach would give nicer patterns, but then all the speed benefits would disappear. I may have already tried it, but can't remember. I do remember making a 3-tap 2D version, just for the fun of it.\n\nI had the same thought with respect to parallax mapping. With particular geometric objects, my mind never quite accepts that a bumped surface is a raised surface.",

Also, other metrics could be used within that grid (may it be simplex or cubic) to create interesting 3d textures I bet.\n\nAlso, if eiffie is reading, might be interesting to use that skewed simplex grid for your \"Tetrahedronator\" (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llf3z8)",

I've come close using an amalgamation of sine and triangle noise, but it doesn't have the same feel.\n\nI've tested the fake Voronoi function out on a few 3D beveled Voronoi shaders here, and it definitely improves frame rate.

        "xaot88, 2014-10-29I'm commenting on my own shader, to provide a little background.  \n\nI was looking for a simple and efficient star field, and what I found were basically two types:\n  (1) Loop over *all* stars and compute the contribution of each star.\n  (2) Use a Hash function, along with Fractal Value Noise or Fractal Perlin Noise (FBM-style), and raise the output to a large power (like 100) to filter out everything except the highest values.\n\nI didn't like approach (1), because it doesn't seems to scale well.  If you have thousands of stars, I think it's too inefficient.\n\nApproach (2) seemed quite promising, but when you look closely at the output, there are strange visual artifacts.  In particular, because Value Noise and Perlin Noise are *continuous*, the output often has visual \"ridges\".  (I.e., some stars come out as short line segments, instead of as points of light.)  Continuous noise functions (like Value and Perlin) are great for modeling *surfaces* like terrain or water.  But, a star field seems (to me) to be better-modeled as discrete points of light.  In my opinion, Value and Perlin Noise are *not* a good model for a star field.  Moreover, the fractal aspects of FBMs are not really useful here either.  I don't see star fields as being fractal.\n\nSo, my approach was to start with a discrete (non-continuous) noise hash, and keep it that way!  I skipped the Value/Perlin approach of making the noise function continuous.  And I skipped the fractal FBM-style generator too.  The resulting star field doesn't have any ridge-like visual artifacts.  And the whole algorithm is much simpler and more efficient than any other starfield shader I've seen.\n\nI look forward to your comments!",

It is running at 144fps for me. If I calculated right, thats something like 70% left after a minute, which does seem to fit my observation.

The thing is I tried everything in your Paint Streams and succeded in a collision rule that enclosed everything and seemed to work (no mass was getting to the rim because I also added a force to send it back out of the collision object) but the fluid still kept disappearing over time. This could be a case of 3), or it is 2) and the amount of mass that escapes through the collision object is just too small to see with the shading I used - or - the mass got stuck right on the surface of the collision object (sucked in like a black hole xD). \n\nSo I am pretty sure that 1) and 3) are a thing, but 2) I think can be avoided with the right collision handling.",

I don't know how others do it.\n\nAnyway, I reasoned to myself a while ago that it'd be impossible to achieve thick equi width isolines on nonlinear functions like this without resorting to more sophisticated methods - like pointilizing the isolines and running Bezier lines through them... Of course, I may be incorrect, in which case, I'd love to see an example.\n\nHowever, with thinner lines, you can at least fake it. How, depends on what you're after. I've used \"x*(1 - x)\"  for smoothing combined with the cheap GPU Minkowski (?) distance \"fwidth.\" I forgot about the simplest case \"1 - x,\" but that'd work too, and might even be better, so I might experiment with it. Commented out is the \"x*x*(3 - 2*x)\" case. Swapping \"fwdith\" for a software Euclidean distance looks even better, but isn't as cheap. I'm currently doing a bumped Voronoi example that tries to use better methods.",

It all depends on the sample spread you're interested in.\n\nIf you were trying to take readings that spanned more than a pixel, then I guess you'd have to take readings for the function itself a couple of times and perform \"fwidth\" by hand. Even so, it'd still be cheaper than supersampling. Having said that, if framerate wasn't a factor, I'd prefer supersampling.\n\n@shau\nVia online pictures, I think I know the particular piece you're referring to. It'd be reasonably easy to make a 3D version. However making something cheap with pixel-precise, frame-shot-quality antialising might prove difficult. I've never really figured out a way to perform cheap 3D antialiasing. You can edge-detect a scene in a buffer, then only supersample the pixels that need doing, but I don't quite find that fast enough yet. One day, when I'm not feeling so lazy, I might put some proper thought into it.",

This is correct since energy is radiated out along the z-axis in addition to within the plane of the visualization.\nLocal average energy would be constant inside a 3d spherical arrangement of sources (no magical disappearance of energy inside this structure, assuming it is filled with free space / lossless propagation medium).",

        "Diapsid, 2020-12-20This concept is used by MIMO antenna arrays like in cell phone towers to direct beams away from interference and towards specific targets. Audio and electromagnetic waves are similar enough that the array theory should work for both. I actually just wrote my first shader program using a circular array, but uniformly spaced with no phase difference between them. I treated each as the origin of a 2D cosine function and added the value of the offset cosines together at each pixel in a for loop. There's a method called the Schelkunoff spaced-zeroes method that takes a linear array and chooses specific amplitudes for each element to direct nulls in specified directions. I might code that up soon in ShaderToy, I've done it Processing and Matlab already for a university course.\n\nI think this method is the one you're thinking of, or at least very similar. Using it on a very large linear array can create arbitrarily large directivity, to the point where energy only radiates in <1\u00b0 beamdwidths in any specified direction, so you could choose a person out of a lineup to hear the sound with no one else being able to. The tradeoff is that it is extremely inefficient, and in antennas instead of radiating away most of the energy, it gets stored in the reactive near-field, which is drastically affected by any object in that area. So you can have 100 antennas broadcasting the signal, but the received signal level may be 1/10000th the magnitude of the transmitted energy. As you let the beam get broader, you gain back your efficiency.",

So if you put a black object in the vicinity of a white \"point light\" you don't actually get shadows, instead, the light is consumed by the black light in the vicinity of the black object.

The most likely cause would be that the red and blue channels of your textures are being swapped for some reason. I can make the shadertoy shader look like this by adding line 203:\ncTextureSample.rgb = cTextureSample.bgr;\nI'm not sure what the cause would be in your environment though. That could happen due to a number of reasons. Also I'm not sure why that would make the mug go yellow as that color is just a shader constant on line 218, i.e. i can change that line to:\nmat.cAlbedo = mix(vec3(1.0, 1.0, 0.0), vColour, cTextureSample.a);\nand it looks like the result you are seeing.",

For each pixel as long as the surface is hit the ray is bounced and it continues up to 3 bounces.\n\nBecause of the reflection the color of the scene comes from the reflected background.

In many circumstances, that means the distance function, which in turn means trying to provide one that's easy calculate and to hone in on.\n\nLayering in order of aesthetic importance helps also. As an example, a lot of people will raymarch several layers of noise. However, raymarching the lower frequency, larger amplitudes and bump mapping the finer details can give a similar aesthetic, but at double the framerate. Replacing the larger amplitudes with sinusoidals can be even faster.\n\nIn regards to the actual voxel traversal algorithm, you'll see that the \"map\" function isn't being converted to the voxelized form, nor is there any boolean logic, so that saves some calls... I think. Little things like that help. Going off on a slight tangent, I've often wondered whether some kind of hybrid sphere-tracing\\voxel-traversal could improve things by increasing step distance... but others haven't tried, so perhaps I'm overlooking something.",

Generally speaking, that's not enough to produce a realistic flythrough (clouds from a distance is possible though), so I opted for a kind of artsy style that got the point across, but it's in no way supposed to represent realism. \n\nProducing realistic clouds isn't the problem; it's trying to do so with as few steps and taps as possible. Computers are pretty fast these days, but there'd be plenty of systems that couldn't run this shader efficiently in its current state, let alone a more GPU intensive one. I have a couple of ideas that I'm going to try out that I think might produce more feature rich clouds, but even then, I'd imagine it'd only be feasible to run on moderately good systems.",

Hopefully, with that and a few other shaders on here, I might be able to cobble something together. \n\n@Dave_Hoskins\nI threw the time component in at the end to provide a bit of animation.

We did that in http://evasion.imag.fr/Publications/2008/BNMBC08/. Maybe you might grab some of the principle to fake something less accurate but still grasping some of the effect. The idea is to separate pack of rays by there number of scattering in the cloud. Low number are only backreflected locally.

I also mentioned that the high cloud density was a style choice. Basically, the clouds are supposed to look a little cartoony. I could change a few things here and there to make it look more conventionally realistic, but I still don't think it would quite right. This particular example uses just 64 steps and two distance field lookups at each one. It's not that much to work with - Just a bit of diffuse and shading. \n\nPutting together a geneuinely realistic looking cloud flythrough would require a fair bit of creativity, since you'd have to provide the illusion of volumetric light and shadows without the huge cost. I'll probably attempt it anyway... or I might save myself the trouble and wait for someone else on here to do it. That's worked well for me in the past. \n\n@aiekick\nGod rays would be great, and they're easy to implement - Just light everything volumetrically. Unfortunately, doing that for every step would be crazy expensive. Having said that, I'd still like to see if it could be done.

The specular lighting is applied independently of surface color (globally, I guess) to make things look shinier, and with a lower specular power to make it more prominent. Other things that effect the overall look are light placement, gamma correction (that's imperative), etc. A lot of the times, it comes down to tweaking the figures until you produce something you're happy with.\n\nThis would have a more gelatinous-like consistency if I were to take out the rigidity. To make it look wetter, I'd probably increase the specular power to something like 64, and multiply it by 3, or something to that effect. Applying some fake diffraction would help too.",

Consider the blue line, we go along the x axis between 0 and 1 then shade a part of the axis blue, specifically between 0.54 and 0.55 on the x axis.\nif (r.x < 0.54 && r.x > 0.55) pixel = color1;\n\nHowever we could consider the distance from 0.545 on the x axis. The line should be filled in if (r.x > 0.545 and r.x < 0.55) or (r.x < 0.545 and r.x > 0.54).\nThis is equivalent to (r.x - 0.545 > 0 and r.x - 0.545 < 0.005) or (r.x - 0.545 < 0 and r.x > 0.54).\n\nConsider |r.x - 0.545| = r.x - 0.545 if r.x - 0.545 is positive or 0\n                                  0.545 - r.x if r.x - 0.545 is negative\n\nSuppose |r.x - 0.545| < 0.005 then if r.x - 0.545 is positive or 0 we have:\n  0 <=  r.x - 0.545 < 0.005\n  0.545 <= r.x < 0.55\nor if r.x-0.545 is negative we have:\n  0 < 0.545 - r.x < 0.005\n  -0.005 < 0.54 - r.x < 0\n  r.x < 0.545 and 0.54 < r.x\n  so 0.54 < r.x < 0.545\n\nThis means that given r.x , it is either (positive or 0) or negative so it fulfills this inequality.\n0.54 < r.x < 0.55\n\nTo now explain what you were asking about, we are never working with inequalities on negative number.\nabs x =  x if x >= 0\n           -x if x   < 0\n\nTry putting in anything and you will see abs(5) = 5, abs(-5) = 5, abs(0) = 0, abs (-3.1415) = 3.1415 etc..., they are never negative. The comment misses out this crucial 'abs' function.\n\nI hope this is clear but if you need to see it visually get a piece of paper, draw a number line from 0 to 100, then consider abs(x - 30) < 10. Try thinking of random x and seeing which fits. You'll see that this is a line from about 1/5 of the paper to 2/5 of the paper.",

Why not just swap the edge0 and edge1 parameters?\n\nTicks: A for-loop causes issues when scaling due to the loop only supporting a finite number of ticks.  If you zoom out (for instance, make scaleFactor=0.5), the x grid stops outside of (-2 : 2).  When teaching the grid system, this is a good opportunity to teach the mod() function.  \n\nWhen scaling you must consider the impact of scaling your anti-aliasing.  Zooming in causes fuzzy edges.  In my solution, I scale my \"clamp\" value to fix this issue. (consider introducing to your rectangle and circle operations as well).  The only snag here is that you also must pass in a scaleFactor to your coordinateGrid().\n\nResult:\n// a function that draws an (anti-aliased) grid of coordinate system\nfloat coordinateGrid(vec2 r, float scaleFactor) {\n    float ret = 0.0;\n\t\n    // Draw grid lines\n    // Added a couple additional variables for cleaner lines\n    const float tickInterval = 0.1;\n    const float tickWidth = 0.001;\n    float tickClamp = 0.005 / scaleFactor;\n    float tickBounds = tickWidth + tickClamp;    \n\n    // Got rid of loop. fixes issues where grid is zoomed beyod (-2 : 2)\n    float xTickVal = mod(r.x, tickInterval);\n    float yTickVal = mod(r.y, tickInterval);\n    ret += smoothstep(tickBounds, tickWidth, xTickVal);\n    ret += smoothstep(tickInterval - tickBounds, tickInterval - tickWidth, xTickVal);\n    ret += smoothstep(tickBounds, tickWidth, yTickVal);\n    ret += smoothstep(tickInterval - tickBounds, tickInterval - tickWidth, yTickVal);\n\n    // Draw the axes\n    const float axisWidth = tickWidth * 3.0;\n    float axisBounds = axisWidth + tickClamp;\n    \n    ret += smoothstep(axisBounds, axisWidth, abs(r.x));\n    ret += smoothstep(axisBounds, axisWidth, abs(r.y));\n\t\n    // if we clamp, no need to divide the result later\n    return clamp(ret, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n\nAnd in the main:\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // ...\n\n    // original\n    ret = mix(ret, col1, coordinateGrid(r, 1.0));\n    // scaled\n    float scaleFactor = 4.; // zoom in this much\n    vec2 q = r / scaleFactor;\n    ret = mix(ret, col2, coordinateGrid(q, scaleFactor));\n\n    // ...\n}",

'0x' is prefix for hex literal and I didn't find if binary literals exist in glsl. For example:\n\"8 == 010 == 0x8\", \"12 == 014 == 0xC\", \"64 == 0100 == 0x40\"",

The first thing I want to try, is to make several low res depth only passes before tracing the main image. Let's say make 3 steps on 16x9 texture, then 10 steps on 480x270, then full res image. Low res passes should stop when distance is lower than pixel size, so next pass can sample depth of previous and continue tracing. Could be done on shadertoy actually.\n\nConstructing base model with marching cubes? Giving the vast range of detail sizes, and the fact that overlaping parts of the mesh will be rasterized several times, this solution doesn't appeal to me. (Also I can't into C++) But I was thinking about generating the mesh in screen space(with geometry shader maybe) that will somehow place more vertexes, where there are edges and thin details. Then vertex shaders will raymarch some steps, and pixel shader will do the rest.",

It achieves this by sampling multiple points within each pixel and then averaging the results to get the final color. This reduces aliasing and produces a smoother image.\n\nTime and Space Deformation: The code uses time and space to create animation and variation in the image. Time is used to animate and change the image over time, while spatial deformation creates interesting visual effects.\n\nDepth of Field: The code uses a simple depth of field effect to blur objects that are far from the focus point. This can give a sense of depth and perspective to the image.\n\nTexture Sampling: The shader samples from a texture to generate color and detail in the image. You can use a variety of textures to create different visual effects.\n\nCylindrical Deformation: The shader deforms the image to create a cylindrical shape. This is a key part of the visual effect created by the shader.\n\nLayering: The shader uses layering to create a sense of depth and complexity in the image. Each layer is rendered separately and then combined to create the final image.\n\nShading/Coloring: The shader uses a combination of different techniques to color the image. This includes things like diffuse shading, texture blending, and color correction.\n\nNon-Uniform Scaling: The shader applies non-uniform scaling to the textures to create an interesting warping effect.\n\nSinusoidal Oscillations: The shader uses sinusoidal functions to create oscillating effects. This could be used to create things like waves or other periodic patterns in the image.\n\nExponential Decay: The shader uses an exponential decay function to reduce the intensity of colors as they move further away from the center. This can give a sense of depth and focus to the image.\n\n[Generated with GPT-4]",

I think I wrote it one night and at the time I had a laptop with an integrated intel GPU so that was actually my target \nThere are a couple of things that make this fast. Firstly, the number of raymarch steps is very low ( kRaymarchIterations 24 ). Secondly, the shading is very simple; There is just a cubemap reflection with some additive light / glow from the orbit trap. As there are no real reflections there is only one raymarch per-pixel. Also, this is a single buffer shader so there is no floating point intermediate buffer getting written to and read from.",

For the first 5-10 seconds I see about 20 fps while, without the forced loop, it gets 18-19 fps.\nCompile time from 2 secs goes down to less than 1 sec. Btw, from my experience mac mini always compiles shaders much faster than windows pcs. On pc, it's hard to browse shaders with preview disabled, while on mac it's rarely a problem. It doesn't matter if the pc is a strong desktop with dedicated gfx or a laptop with an integrated gfx, compile times are always significantly worse than on puny mac mini... Why is that?

Valve's dithering is also oddly delicate only adding roughly +/-0.2 to the value 0-255 color value. For best results from dithering you really want to do a +1.5 to -0.5 noise range.

But it's not true in floats, and even less in GPU floats (if fast math happened to be activated). \n- detail: preprocessor math are a totally separate path; you can't be totally sure than asin(1) = asin(x) for dynamic x = 1. and it ignore IEEE goodies.\n- sometime having an accurate PI, sqrt(2), sqrt(x), normalization is vital for the program to work, and sometime not.

The hard part is the last you mention: caustics.  There may be an analytical way to do caustics with a sphere, but I'm not sure what it is, if it exists.

        "demofox, 2017-01-12@xmk Doing the naive / brute force implementation, the ray needs to split into two rays whenever it hits a surface, which means exponential complexity.  In practice though, you could do some things to reign that in, based on whatever trade offs you are willing to make.\n\nOne idea that seems appealing to me would be to do like I'm doing where you always follow the refractive ray, but do a 1 bounce reflection at each intersection.\n\nThat may be good enough on it's own, but if you combine that with temporal AA, on the first frame you'll have single bounce reflections, and on the second frame, you'll have single bounce reflections OF single bounce reflections (so have 2 bounces), and on the third frame you'll have triple bounce reflections and so on.\n\nSo, a single frame would be iterative (follow the refraction path!) but due to temporal AA, it would appear as if you worked recursively and also followed the reflection paths.\n\nI can't claim credit for this though, Killzone does this and I got it from a SIGGRAPH talk where they talk about it (:\n\nIt really seems like that technique could have some play in trying to do real time path tracing, where each frame you follow a single path of the ray per pixel, and rely on temporal AA to sort of average them over time.",

        "demofox, 2017-01-11That's a really good question that I personally don't have a good answer for.  I once was making a little hobby project of a real time raytraced FPS where axis aligned boxes defined rooms, that could have portals on the wall that led to other AA boxes, and each box contained information about it's contents.  It worked ok, but there was no magic there and it wouldn't have scaled well.  You can see a video of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARjAtkwaS0.\n\nRight now I'm starting a hybrid rasterization / ray tracing / ray marching game project inspired by marble madness that I intend to finish and ship.\n\nMy plan here is to do some rasterization of polygons, but then for things which are ray traced or ray marched, i'll draw a scaled / oriented cube that contains them, and do the ray based work in the pixel shader.\n\nThe goal is to have those ray rendered objects be representable as minimally as possible so that every object will have access to every other object to allow reflection and refraction against these objects.\n\nI'd also like for them to have access to the rasterized rendering so that they can use that information for screen space glossy reflections, maybe falling back to reflection probes when that information isnt available..\n\nIt would also be nice, when doing the rasterization pass, to have access to the ray based objects, so that the rasterized geometry could also get reflections and maybe refractions?\n\nLastly, I might try to have things just have a limited number of reflection (and refraction?) bounces, and use temporal anti aliasing to try and harvest the information from the last frame as much as possible, so that (like in Killzone) each frame you render gives you another ray bounce.\n\nIt seems like it would be interesting when limiting ray bounces to try a monte carlo approach where you randomly choose which ray to take based on say, the fresnel reflection vs refraction multiplier.\n\nI have one more shadertoy I want to make (I want to try for glitter / metal flake style surfaces), but after that am starting in on the project.\n\nWho knows how it will actually turn out and whether these ideas will be practical when the rubber hits the road, or get me the results I want.

I like to get other people's take on things.\n\nI know it's possible to emulate recursive raytracing in a pixel shader using a stack, but speed is still an issue, especially when rendering anything interesting. I've experimented by hand coding the first reflective and refractive pass, then entering the multiple bounce loop (choosing the strongest ray) from there. It kind of looks OK, and speed is OK with just three or four extra bounces, but it's messy... \n\nI guess there'll come a day when random pixel access on the CPU will be faster than our best graphics cards, but then soft shadows and volumetrics will slow things down. Sadly, by the time computers are able to do what I'd like them to, I'll be too old to care. Anyway, I guess I should get back to my current minimal, abstract scene with no bounces. Sigh!",

I use them all the time for a range of different things: Foundation layers, cheap noise, etc. The combination I've used in this particular example is just a cheap way to provide extra variation, to make the surface look a little more haphazard. Explaining what combinations work for what situation would take a while, but it's easy enough to figure out after experimenting a bit.\n\nFor instance, in 2D:\nsin(p.x + p.y)\nsin(p.x)*sin(p.y)\nsin(p.x) + sin(p.y) = dot(sin(p), vec2(1))\nsin(p.x + cos(p.y)) + sin(p.y + cos(p.x)) = dot(sin(p + cos(p.yx)), vec2(1))\n// etc.\n\nYou can also combine sinusoidal layers at difference frequencies and amplitudes in the same way fBm noise is produced.",

If genuine 3D Voronoi was involved, it'd be running very slow on all computers.

I went with a distance metric that produced an abstract angular look, but organic surfaces are possible too. Aiekick has some examples that use different distance metrics that are pretty interesting.",

However, if I were forced to describe ambient occlusion in a few words, it would be that it's a measure of how much ambient light is blocked due to the surrounds. In very simple terms, it's described as self shadowing.\n\nMost algorithms used on Shadertoy are very basic estimations, designed to minimize calls to the distance function. More sophisticated algorithms use the half hemisphere\\random ray setup. The algorithm above, however, involves starting at the surface, then stepping off of it in the direction of the normal checking to see if another part of the scene is nearby. In open spaces, lighter values are returned. Whereas, in corners, crevices, etc, darker values are returned. It's not perfect, but it does a pretty good job.\n\nTo confuse things, this particular scene also incorporates curvature and performs fake shadowy coloring via the tiled function itself. The curvature calculation is probably the one responsible for lightening the convex border regions.",

That isn't a bad thing necessarily, but I am getting older, and I've set a goal for myself to try to actually learn enough to create a raymarching shader for clouds for Unity this year if I can, which I will probably testbed on Shadertoy. In general I imagine I can probably do it, given enough time - teaching shaders like yours which have full commenting on them really help. \n\nRotating a camera within the raymarcher based on user input, mouse or axis based,  is something I definitely need to master next - do you have any advice or links on that, or any shaders where you allow the user to rotate the camera?",

Anyway, trust me, you don't need a tutor to learn how to raymarch. It's pretty easy to learn, but if you have any questions, my email address is in my profile.\n\nIn general there are just a few steps involved. I find that it's best to start with a template - usually one that involves a simple straight line camera through a repeat field of spheres or cubes, then take it from there. Once you've got the hang of the overall template usage, you can learn each of the individual components - like unit ray setup, scene traversal, lighting the hit point, etc.",

Eventually, they'd all be updating, anyway.\n\nI was under the impression, and still am, that \"v *= M\" and \"v = v*M\" do exactly the same thing, right down to the electrical distribution in the circuits, so they should either both work, or both fail... but I've been wrong before, so you never know. I could cry about it, or just make the changes. I think I'll do the latter. \n\nCheap SSS is something I can never get quite right. \"TekF\" has some interesting examples, one in particular. For cheap surface glow, normal bending gives OK results. \n\nBy the way, I could make this look a \"lot\" nicer by marching out (about 3 to 8 steps) from each particle towards the light source to accumulate some shadowing, but that's multiple times the \"map\" calls. Fast computers are OK with it, but it'd cripple the average user's machine.",

Just curious, does it affect my other shaders, or other peoples? If so, I'll make the changes to all of them, albeit begrudgingly. Damn browsers. \n\nIn regards to multipass light scattering, it's a big ask. As far as framerate goes, the multiple passes are the stumbling block.  Seriously, though, it'll be interesting to see what you come up with. I wouldn't be surprised if the look could be faked, to some extent.\n\nAt present, I'm trying to meld this technique with solid structures.

Now it is ready to be displayed in a new art museum :-P\n\n\"In this piece the artists wants to draw attention to the Gouldian aspects of evolution that are indifferent about complexity. It is an objection to the popular Dawkinsian interpretation in which there is an absolute measure of complexity towards which species evolve.\n\nThese species evolve playfully and carefree at the belly of the mother earth, waiting unknowingly for the next catastrophe that'll drastically change the evolutionary landscape.\"",

I haven't tried to decipher this yet, so I'm in random guess mode. \n\nOn a side note, the noise function can be reduced to use fewer \"fract\" calls, etc. Whether the compiler cares or not, I wouldn't know, but fewer fract calls is a good thing, right? \nfloat noise(vec2 p){\n    \n    vec4 w = floor(p).xyxy + vec4(0, 0, 1, 1);\n    p -= w.xy; // Fract.\n    \n    float\n    x1 = mix(hash(w.xy), hash(w.xw), p.y),\n    x2 = mix(hash(w.zy), hash(w.zw), p.y);\n    return mix(x1, x2, p.x);\n}\n\nOf course, we each have faster noise functions that could be dropped in.",

I even put my minimized source into the shadertoy editor to check if it is correct, and it was.\nUnfortunately (sigh) I didn't check the shadertoy counter neither before I copied the original code nor before pasting the minimized code into it so I was blissfully unaware of the current length of your code...\nAnyway, it probably seemed to you as if I was a smartass or something pointing out that your beautiful shader is 1 char longer than reported. Sorry... My mistake.\n\nBtw, that difference of 1 char is because of a bug in shadertoy counter which happens when return is followed by a newline before actual value which is returned. You have such case in lines 14 and 15.\n(it's the same bug because of which newlines are not properly counted after using macros, after variable types, and after struct keyword)",

To compute the \n reflection and refraction directions and coefficients, in the first case \n (air-water interface) you need to set n1 and n2 to the water and air\n refractive index respectively (while this ORDER IS REVERSED\n IN THE SECOND CASE).\"\n\nSo you should swap indices of refraction, not invert them.

This is luckily also where two consecutive SDF measurements refer to a surface point close to each other, meaning that triangulation result is close to perfect. Rays passing along a surface will not triangulate properly (SDF samples don't measure distance from the same point). But these rays have no banding issues either.

In our case, the SDF returns the closest distance to most probably different points. However the assumption is they are close enough that triangulation gives you a pretty good approximation to the closest point on the surface that is closest to the line we are marching on (a perpendicular distance). Given it's an improvement and it's virtually free, there's no reason not to use it compared to the traditional method.\n\nThe need for a marching step scale factor, biases or clamping, is a totally orthogonal issue to the traditional vs new proposed distance estimation of S.Aaltonen (sebbbi) - you might still want to use those tricks regardless of the underlying distance estimation method (direct or improved/triangulated), since after all we are scanning the ray line at intervals that might fail to capture the actual closest distance, which is needed to prevent light leaking.",

Wanted to thank you again for the demo, I finally got around to implementing a shader for my pet project here: http://davidson16807.github.io/tectonics.js/ Your demo helped a lot in the process. I also found an interesting approach you can use to eliminate one of the nested for loops in the raymarch code, using a closed form approximation. I wrote up an example shader for that here: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3dBSDW",

When doing the lighting for a single step along the ray, the probability of the ray hitting/viewing any particle/fog/medium is then (1 - stepTransmittance) and that probability drives the amount of light scattering that can happen along that step of the ray.",

If you've ever set a torch in a large cave, you'll know what I mean: the light propagates from the light source in an octahedral pattern, but it is done over a series of frames to save computation time. This shader seems to behave in a similar manner but instead of saving the result, it is continuously refreshing the buffer in which the lighting data is stored.

Simplex should be everyone's default choice before considering other noise algos IMO. Tip, for caves: Take two snoise evaluations (offset enough vertically to hide similarities) and do valueA^2 + valueB^2 < 0.02 ? cave : nocave. It carves out round-ish tunnels with some interesting variation in parts. Change the threshold (0.02) and frequencies, and maybe add a second octave to one or both if desired.\n\nAlso for anyone wanting to use Simplex noise 3D for texturing (rather than world gen) in the US, I've put out this algo: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wt3GRf (Named OpenSimplex2F in other places). It could use optimization (particularly in the gradient picker), but it's functional and addresses the same issues in Perlin/Value that \"real\" Simplex does.",

Could try putting the getVoxels in e.g. calcLightingFancy into a loop, filling an array, instead of 9 loose calls.  That sort of thing might help if using uniforms on the loop variable to prevent inlining.  I don't have any other suggestions atm.

        "dcerisano, 2022-07-01@ollj, the point and strength of Gold Noise is it deliberately takes advantage of limited precision.\n\nIt is not  the precise evaluation of the function that is important - it is the non-deterministic forced error.\n\nThis error arises from the iterative computation of trig functions in the GPU, a source of much consternation usually, since different VBIOS will return non-deterministically different precision. \n\nGold Noise takes advantage of this (likely the only advantage of this).  The inclusion of an irrational number like PHI sufficiently exacerbates the non-determinism. \n\nI gave PHI to a ridiculous level of precision for current GPU cores. As these cores evolve, PHI can just be given with an arbitrarily higher level of precision, and hopefully Gold Noise should be able to survive indefinitely!\n\nbtw - I tried some of your suggestions, but none resulted in a better distribution without considerably more processing required.",

I call this \"pqfm=prime-quadratic-field-matrix\"\nmetallic-means are a subset of quadratic-fields, and PHI is likely a great start here. the tan() does not really help as much as a simple seesaw or triangle wave.\n\nGood efficient hashes/noises are a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register with a long period. They usually do a lot of xor in type uint.\nThey get slightly better, when they include mod(), making them an LCG = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator\nAbove 2 hashes are extremely common in arcade games.\nThey get extremely good, when you permute more than 1 of them to a PLCG = PCG = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permuted_congruential_generator\n\nif you want fast uniformity with long prime-permutation-periods, you can get great 3d noise with only modulo and some tiny lookUpTables that store costasArrays if unique-prime-lengths. This does a bit more mod and no xor, with the benefit of having much longer prime-factor-periots.\nA 32 bit pcg will have a period of (up to) 4,294,967,296, ideally by permuting 2 16 bit linear feedback shift registers, likely in the complexity of less than 6 modulo per iteration (if its not a full bit period, its likely also not uniform).\n\nmultiplying the sizes of 9 different primes (that are>9) via costas arrays gets you over a period of 1 million in the size of prime-faxctorization, likely at the cost of 9*3=27 modulo (or 9*4?) BUT every single costas array is pattern-free, which in theory makes this a much better noise AND costas noise in theory parallelizes more, and they need no iterating over them.",

This is the part of the actual code:\n\n#if defined(ANALYTICAL_DERIVATIVES)\n\t//pn.y, pn.z contain partial derivatives dNoise(xyz)/x and dNoise(xyz)/y. dNoise(xyz)/z is irrelevant because z was a time uniform\n\tvec3 va = vec3(1.0, pn.y, 0.0);\n\tvec3 vb = vec3(0.0, pn.z, -1.0);  //no idea why minus\n#else //numerical derivatives\n\tconst float off = 0.01;\n\tconst float off2 = 2.0 * off;\n\n\tfloat s01 = noise( uvHm - vec2( off, 0.0 ) ).x;\n\tfloat s21 = noise( uvHm + vec2( off, 0.0 ) ).x;\n\tfloat s10 = noise( uvHm - vec2( 0.0, off ) ).x;\n\tfloat s12 = noise( uvHm + vec2( 0.0, off ) ).x;\n\tvec3 va = vec3(off2, s21 - s01,  0.0);\n\tvec3 vb = vec3(0.0 , s12 - s10, -off2); //no idea why minus\n#endif\n\nyzw = normalize( cross(va, vb) );\n\nOnly this way I was able to match numerical (calculated) and analytical derivatives.\n\nIn this example the code uses derivatives directly (instead of making them normals) and somehow it does work.

There's a whole bunch of things that I like about it.\n\nApplying the step function when accumulating the local density is a nice touch. Of course, if you need to do anything expensive during the accumulation stage, it's back to that annoying \"if\" statement. \n\nMost of all, I like the way you break from the loop when the surface distance is within a fractional distance of the total. I've applied that to some similar code I have, and it's improved things a lot.\n\nI got excited when I saw the evenly distributed spikes, then realized they were hardcoded. You can comment out \"n1\" to \"n3,\" by the way. Either way, it's given me an idea as to how to evenly distribute spikes on any object efficiently... maybe.\n\nFor what it's worth, I made a fiery version. I trimmed your version down a bit, changed the weighting slightly, made a couple of sacrifices to the spike shape in order to tighten up the distance equation, etc. Nothing exciting, but here it is:\n\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lBXzy",

At any rate, I'm never quite sure what timing mechanism is used in the background.

Anyway, I've been playing around with the cubemap feature lately, just to see what's possible. The upside is that you can precalculate some pretty complex surfaces without having to worry about frame rate. The downside is resolution and the need to interpolate between 8 voxels, etc. Having said that, I'm pretty sure there'd be ways around it.",

You mentioned that it helps shuffle the data, but neat to know that if you started with (good histogram) white noise that maybe that'd be a way to go.\n\nRemoving the chance limit check (regardless of whether force limit check is there) makes it really blocky though and it doesn't converge, which i'm surprised about!  Do you know why that is?\n\nIf not, I wonder if it's because it's the max of two chances so isn't uniform anymore?\n\nIs it really swapping just 2 pixels every frame? Maybe it isn't and the 50% chance to swap helps avoid problems?\n\nI can drop chance_limit down to 0.1 and if no other changes are made, it seems to converge at the same rate.",

It is a solution perfectly matched to this specific problem and a fun thing to think about, but to be brutally honest I'm finding it doesnt generalise to practical scenarios extremely well, from experiments so far. It's bad for perf to do density computation, lighting computation for each sample of each ray on the fly. And holding the sampling error stationary like this is probably inferior to jittering the sampling and temporally filtering the result - the error is large and disturbing for shadow boundaries. In any case, research is in progress here, a few scenes and techniques are being explored: https://github.com/huwb/volsample . \n\nAnyway in regards to your questions.. I have a WIP presentation that i could share with you which has latest and greatest thinking - email me if you're interested, my contact details are on the github. For a tetrahedron the individual planes would be clearly visible due to camera perspective effects. A dodecahedron does a much better job. We generate geom for a bevelled dodecahedron and render it around the camera. Your intuitions about ray counts are spot on.. The bevel faces have a specific shader applied that marches the right number of rays, and the normals are stored per face, so everything is ready to go for the pixel shader. No branches or significant overhead at runtime, besides requiring additional raymarches. Only a tiny fraction of pixels require all 3 raymarches, i think around 1%. Around 18% needed two rays though.",

Did you try using a branch to determine how many planes you need to trace?\n\nIn some parts of the screen you only need to consider axis-aligned planes and in other areas you only need to consider diagonal planes - it's only in regions where two planes blend together that you need to trace both at once.\n\nThe branch should be coherent in image-space so it should give you a speedup (esp if you need to blend 3 planes together for a full 3D version), assuming the single-plane trace function is significantly quicker than the 2 or 3 plane function.",

Did it look awful with fewer planes?\n\nI wonder what the minimum number of planes will be for full 3D... you could get away with 4 for a tetrahedron, but then if you need 8 planes for '2.5D' to look good I guess you'll need more for full 3D.\n\nI like the dodecahedron idea since it's platonic, but utilizing the symmetries with your truncated cube does sound simpler! What about an octahedron? Oh hmm, I guess that has the disadvantage that 4 planes meet at a point (as opposed to just 3 for a dodecahedron or truncated cube) so you'd need to march+blend more planes per pixel.",

I've wanted for a long time to do cone tracing on a procedural field in a shadertoy shader. The idea is to provide a radius with the map(vec3) > vec4 function of standard volumetric shader. Since noise in a FBM is usually between 0 and 1 we can blend it to 0.5 when the frequency is higher than the radius. Cone tracing a SDF is done the same way than a participating media, the only difference is that the alpha is binary (which allow us to trace through it way faster when it's empty, thanks to the SDF).

I put embarrassingly little effort into this, so I'm surprised it was noticed at all.\n\n@Dave_Hoskins\nNot normalizing \"rd\" after distorting it was a major oversight on my part. I couldn't understand why the highlights never quite looked right, and I think you just solved the problem... I almost feel guilty for all the free help I receive on this site. \n\n@eiffie\nIf I'm not feeling lazy, I'll sometimes use the Schlick approximation to tone down the specular component. Curvature on the specular lighting. I'll give it a go. I usually use Nimitz's curvature formula. I'm aware it can be rolled into the normal calculation, but I remember curvature and normal calculations often relied on different sample distances (epsilon value), so I normally calculate it separately... unless I'm not calculating curvature correctly, which is entirely possible.\n \n@iq\nThe object is made of highly reflective, polished, super-compressed, lacquered timber... Nah, I'm not buying it either, so I've toned the reflections down. It was sad seeing see that extra shininess disappear, but I guess it was the right thing to do. \n\n@casty\nEven without the unrealistic reflections, my brain would never accept this scenario. I still can't explain that weird blue light, and no one could afford that amount of timber.  Either way, your comment has me wondering what an additional refractive pass would look like.

The idea behind this is to render a basic scene into \"Buf A,\" read it in from the \"Image\" tab, then radial blur it. Pretty straight forward stuff.\n\nFrom what I can gather from the image, the lattice structure perhaps isn't showing up, then just the background is being blurred out? Out of curiosity, if you transcribe the scene from \"Buf A\" into the \"Image\" tab, then delete \"Buf A,\" does it render as a normal scene? I'm trying to figure out which tab is causing the problems.\n\nOn another note, on my older computer, IE refuses to render a lot of the stuff on Shadertoy these days, including this (instruction count, maybe), so I've given up trying to accommodate it.",
