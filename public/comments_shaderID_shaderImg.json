        "screeb, 2021-11-23This (and every other exact-distance Bezier implementation that I've seen, as they all use the Cardano method, it seems) suffers from a significant floating-point precision issue. It's not easily (or at all) visible in 2D if the line is thick enough, or depending on the control points, but if it's used in 3D (like with the revolution function), it can create a big nasty, noisy split in the object.\n\nYou can see it here if you set:\n\nvec2 p = (2.0*fragCoord-iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y*0.25 + vec2(4.0, 6.0);\nvec2 m = (2.0*iMouse.xy-iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y*0.25 + vec2(4.0, 6.0);\n\nvec2 v0 = vec2(3.4, 8.75);\nvec2 v1 = vec2(5.9, 0.0);\nvec2 v2 = vec2(0.0, 0.0);\n\nFortunately, there's an easy solution that I came up with.\n\nAfter the vec2 x = (vec2(h,-h)-q)/2.0; line in the 1 root section, simply add this:\n\nif(abs(abs(h/q) - 1.0) < 0.0001)\n{\n    x = vec2(p3/q, -q - p3/q);\n\n    if(q < 0.0)\n        x = x.yx;\n}\n\nIt could definitely be optimised, but it demonstrates the fix.\n\nWhat's happening is that when h and q are nearly equal (which is in areas surrounding p = 0), the floating point error becomes huge, as we need the difference between them, but the precision is lost.\n\nMy solution is to estimate x with a calculation that doesn't suffer from this. The estimate is very good when h and q are close, so it works well, provided the threshold value is reasonable (0.0001 seems to do the job).",

This is a kind of collection of bad hacks, in some ways.  If you truly want to fix it before that - you're more than welcome to copy/remix it, as far as I'm concerned.  Most of the source shaders are either ShareAlike or not explicitly licensed, so it seems unlikely anyone would mind...\n\nI'm more interested in figuring out how to replicate the concepts I accidentally discovered with more proper physical and 3D modeling.  The hyperdisc has the nice functionality of providing fractal details down to the smallest possible resolution - so I've noticed this shader scales to a fullscreen far better than many of the other noise concepts I'm exploring.  However, that only occurs near the \"infinite tunnel\" near the asymptote of the disc.  \n\nDo you or any others have ideas on how to replicate that \"true fractal\" nature on a more properly modeled ocean/clouds/fire/other physical wavenoise-based phenomena?",

I'm a totally noob about this, not sure if this is really an issue. \n\nSecond: If i post a sound cloud link on Shadertoy, i can't delete the music content anymore, - it should be possible to add \"just a simply empty\" string so the sound cloud music disappears, currently I have to replace it with other music content. \n\nBig Thank you.\nKeep it up",

The fifth degree smoothing formula (with four samples) takes away the seam lines you see when raymarching, but I find it leaves things looking too squarish.

        "ollj, 2017-09-19there is no clear correlation between the disk and spin of a galaxy, relative to its neighbors or great voids.\n\nthere is no clear correlation between the orbital planes of a planet and the relative position of a star within a galaxy. The relatively small scale spin of a a concatenating cloud that forms a solar system makes one angular momentum dominate within <2 billion years, creating a disk shaped cloud. We can only (almost only) measure extra-solar planets in systems where the orbits are nearly coplanar with out position in space. binary systems simplify this, as we can tell heir spin more easily.\n\nThere is no clear correlation between the compositions of 2 solar systems, wether any gas giant is further inside or outside. There is a significant gap in our observations, a lot of earth like planets could exist, but we fail to measure a most of them in a certain range of mass and density. within a range of measures where we expect to find a lot,we barely find anything.But all around that spot we find gas giants and smaller more dense things.\n\nGalaxy Disks are generally a lot thinner than in your shader. they glow a lot in infrared and often have a ultraviolet beam/halo trough their pole due to a strong magnetic field due to alof of angular momentum with short distances (quasars and black holes)\n\nThere are 2 distinct galaxy types. high density galaxies tent to form disks and have brighter stars with more supernovae.\n\nLower density galaxies have much more and much smaller starts, the galaxies stay larger, and contain more but smaller stars that burn slower, exist longer,have  less supernovae, and they stay spherical and glow mostly yellow.\n\nGalaxies also tent to have smaller galaxies that orbit them, a bit like a moon, but the larger scale orbitals are a lot less stable over time and collisions (colliding dust clouds) will happen.",

The advantage of macro is just for the programmer: more concise (good for trivial small things), plus the only way to have the same function operating on float/vec2/vec3/vec4, plus the only way to overload builtin functions. \n- I'm pretty sure you can have your very complex scene + effect in better perfs and compilation time. Just it suppose you organize correctly at start the structures, algorithmic strategies, and some compromise impacting the early scene design. Learning this on an already writen long project is probably not the best way. As I said earlier, efficient SIMD programming is very different to efficient CPU programming, and in term of compilation burden it is even more different than in terms of perfs.

A simplest performance tweak is to increase camera distance, at least for the first few frames. increasing the Field of View has a similar effect, the more your view is filled with \"nothing==simpler shapes==filler\" the more fps you get. The trick is to exploit your memory of higher detail, while mostly showing a lowres zoomed out image or something of lower complexity often occluding something of higher complexity.\n\n#define performance differences depend on how you use it in what context. #define performance generally had surprising benefits if only due to:\n- thinking more about structure and symmetry, avoiding repetitions, using swiveling more efficiently (very cheap 90deg rotation) , folding domains, playing topological-manifold - origami. There are some trigonometry paper folding axioms that come down to binomials and sign(a); Used to design window shades and solar panels.\n- less repetition, less code to load, memorize and parse. cognitive load matters. abstraction helps. #define aliases are instances of abstraction. Parsing becomes more like a L-systemsystem, almost a cellular automaton, where, small code can expand a lot. This can appear as if they create more aperiodic tessellations from self, as if information comes from nothing, while actually just being an expanding fractal with simple repeating symmetries. You can exploit this in a long loading bar (bad) or just realize that keeping the iteration cont short is likely for the best. -> if you use a #define very often in very similar contexts, you are likely lacking awareness of a simple symmetry, likely a simple (a)periodic tiling is not being utilized for performance then.\nThe fun part of cellular automata is hat some are even  Turing complete L-system fractals.",

This in a different more general more dynamic context. A good basis to simplify, but not a good basis for general assumptions.\nA lot of simplification comes from making relative object properties more static, objects or cameras being less mobile.\nideally place static objects physically within quadtrees. \nEveryone easily underestimates the benefits of using STATIC differential properties for better performance, when differences between 2 thins change less often, or never.\nThe F# language insists on teaching you this, by making \"static\" the default type and by requiring \"mutable\" to be explicitly stated.\nMake many differentials powers of 2, 3 or 5 and things simplify more.\nWhen the relation between object and camera is more constrained, it often makes sense to use some special conservative shortcuts, especially when curvature is simpler, local extremas are easier to estimate (no discontinuities), when an object is mostly convex, when a polynomial can be simplified to (multiple) binomials. \nThis often ends up substituting analysis with a heuristic iterative process, like Newton's method or with a loop that behaves like a binary search that is more implicit and less precise or less mutable, using interval aritmetic for more performance.\nIf your shape is convex and easily differentiable, you can often skip right to its second derivative, and take its curvature for a bounary, to quikly estimate some higher power local extrema.\nfwidth() is low in precision, but generally good enough to very quickly estimate curvature over 2 domains, like SSAO.\n\n* Heuristic loops:\nThe shortcut choice  is to abort a loop when your precision reaches a good enough threshold. That shreshold can be loosened on dynamic conditios.\nThis comes in useful when you calculate [shortest point along a ray to an object], as part of tracing a possible intersection.\nrunning out of time, being far away from the camera, just screw precision, even screw a possible surface further away, just ship it, even with minor errors.\nHeuristics applies the Sunk cost fallacy to analysis.\nHeuristics is generally good enough for visuals, its not like you send astronauts into orbit.\nA raymarching loop is inherently heuristic, twiddle its epsilon and see the difference.\nHeuristics speeds up convergence a lot, often resulting in smoother and higher fps over time.\n\n* The downside to heuristics is that it adds for() loops to your code.:\n* * This is often parsed by adding a branch between every iteration. This can result in slightly slower compile and run time than an analytic approach.\n* * This is often parsed by unrolling the loop, which has the tendency to crash some GFG driver implementations in a stack-heap-collision on old hardware with less memory.\n* * - easily worked around by setting initial constants to very few iterations, \n* * - with a wrapper can benchmark performance and add iterations while framerate stays high.",

It can make sense to sort Bounding-volumes by TextureID; the same bounding volume can easily contain the same TextureID, making handling of multiple textures simpler.\n\nA key to good compile time is to use the same patterns with different parameters, domains as parameters, and with swiveled domains even if that only lowers loading time, that is still part of parsing time,a parser needing less memory.\n\n---\n\nThis bridges a gap between making a FinalFantasy7 Prerendered static 3d background and using the same geometry for a lower resolution lower detail real-time rendering.\n\ndo not just ban it. just fix your animated preview with a button to overwrite it to a stable static preview.",

        "huwb, 2014-05-03Your second comment made me think about the difference between the ocean geometry use case and volume rendering. I'll talk about volume rendering (this shader) first and then compare with the ocean case.\n\nAs far as I can tell, for efficient volume rendering, our pixel rays are fixed. Which means we have only one degree of freedom - the sample distances along each ray. We can't avoid the samples moving when the camera strafes/rotates. Thankfully though, the screen is relatively densely sampled (by pixels), and these particular sampling issues are usually not obvious.\n\nSo X and Y are relatively densely sampled whereas Z is not densely sampled at all. This is why keeping the samples semi-stationary in Z makes such a dramatic difference (the point of this shader).\n\nSo we're left to choose the sample distances. And this is what you eloquently referred to as fixed Z vs fixed distance sampling. On Pirates we used a half way between the two, tweaked by eye. I think it would be possible to derive the optimal 'curvature' of the sample positions, and also how much to move the samples when the camera moves foward/backward. Or perhaps change it dynamically based on the camera movement?\n\nPopping occurs when new samples are introduced at new locations. For this shader this happens only at the rear of the view. This can be addressed but that is a different story. But we don't get the kind of popping you are talking about if I understood correctly.\n\nFor the ocean mesh we were snapping the mesh to certain rotations. In this case samples would pop in and out at the sides. The solution is simply to make sure that the verts and edges that pop are entirely offscreen (by making the mesh cover a slightly wider FOV than the screen). Then popping is not an issue - because it is not visible. Does that make sense?",

But its probably already a standard technique in some other field - theres no such thing as a new idea!\n\nThere is at least one algorithm to keep the samples completely stationary: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldXSzn . I'm not sure its useful though because you have to think about how to integrate steps through a volume and it may be awkward to handle samples blending in, whereas it is elegant for the tree approach where samples split/merge (line 228 to 233).\n\nThere might be other ways to get an adaptive sampling based on splits/merges, without doing real intersections with the tree. I have a fuzzy idea about it but wasn't able to get anything written down.\n\nWhat would be really handy is an implementation of either strategy that generates the sample distances efficiently in a shader.

At the moment, I'm using similar methods to create a simple rocky flythrough.\n\nAnyway, feel free to use this for whatever you wish. It'd be interesting to see what you can come up with.\n\n@Duke\nIf I wasn't lazy, I could probably come up with an analytic normal calculation and save a bunch of calculations. Thankfully, this runs pretty quickly anyway. What I'd like to improve is the way in which the ray hones in on the surface, and Paniq's code might be able to help with that.

As we know, pretty much every noise is a bounded distance field (value, gradient, etc..) as long as you guarantee that |gradient| <= 1 (this is often overlooked detail in Perlin's classic gradient noise). It would be nice of course to have true distance field and |gradient| = 1, but even here, if you use smin, it can get pretty low and slow down your ray-marching. So the problem with boundness is not the noise itself, but the fact you may be scaling and adding noise values FBM-style for artistic purposes (say to get less or more roughness) and the resulting complex function is usually not bounded and hard to tune, so at the end you have to scale down your ray-marching step.\n\nSo, what guarantees boundness here is not the underlying noise function, but really the fact you are \"carving\" with the noise = using smooth boolean subtraction operation (smax) instead of adding and scaling noise values. See wlt3z8, where I achieve exact same thing with just a value noise - I did scale noise values a bit to assure |gradient| <= 1, but I didn't modify ray-marching step.\n\nShane, P_Malin: about Voronoi variation / offseting centers, this indeed looks like special case of Power Diagram Voronoi. Just check out my old closest_circle function there, or just hold LMB to see the \"noise\" function. This one is a special case with offsets set to 0 and smin instead of min, which is never-the-less cool modification idea! And of course, Inigo is always good at presenting it in a good use-case.",

The problem is that the search space becomes 3x3x3 or even 4x4x4 instead of 2x2x2, and things get too slow so I haven't published any. I also tried simplexnoise-like tetrahedral tiling to reduce the number of primitives, but I didn't get it to look as good as I wanted (you can try it setting line 23 to 1).\n\nI think the right thing to do to push this further is just embracing the fact that you need to go at least 3x3x3 in order to get truly randomized and smoother noiseSDF, and just deal with it.\n\nI also tried box shapes, but I didn't try shells nor I tried mixing them ll together.

        "Shane, 2018-09-17This is comparatively boring compared to some of the \"Shaders of the Week\" I've seen lately, but I'll take the win.  Seriously though, I'd recommend rendering a grid of hexagons to anyone who hasn't done it.\n\n@mackycheese21\nIf you've never put one of these together, I'd start with a simple rendering of a square pylon grid - Refer to the \"blocks\" function in my \"Random Block Passage\" example. After that, render the same with each row or column offset by half a grid cell for that brick-like pattern. At that stage, you can swap the square pylons for hexagonal ones. If you have enough space between pylons, then you only need to render one set of repeat objects. The problem arises when you wish to render them against one another. At that point, neighboring cells need to be considered to avoid artifacts, which means you need to render in groups of four...\n\nYeah, I'd be confused at this point too, but if you try to render a square pylon grid from scratch, I promise you'll figure it out.  \n\n@Nick120100\nThere might be converters out there, but the only way I can think of doing it is by painstakingly replacing the GLSL functions with the Cg\\HLSL equivalents. However, the only real thing of interest here is the distance function, which appears to use pretty general syntax, like \"min,\" \"floor,\" \"abs,\" \"fract,\" etc. I'd imagine anything else could be taken care of with defines, like \"#define vec3 float3,\" etc.",

        "Shane, 2018-06-05Thanks, everyone. This was just a quick diversion, so not a great deal of effort was put into it. There's nothing technically difficult about producing hexagonal grid imagery like this, but having to render four objects (three minimum) to avoid overlap can be costly for anything but the simplest of shape combinations. On a side note, storing some of the calculations ahead of time in a second buffer might go some way toward speeding up the process.\n\nThere are so many variations on this particular hexagonal setup that it was difficult to pick one. Hopefully, someone with more enthusiasm and imagination might put something more interesting together. \n\n@flockaroo and @leonmiura\nIn regard to producing some cheap neon reflections, I'm waiting for inspiration to strike.  My best bet would probably be rendering a low-iteration second pass on a less detailed distance function, etc, so I might add that in at some stage. I didn't want to use a second buffer, but I'd imagine a bokeh blur, radial blur, or something to that effect, would give more of a reflective light feel too.",

I've changed the shader now so that a reflected ray is cast for the first intersection and also if the surface has no transparency or in the case of total internal reflection. I think it has picked up the edge-of-bowl and underside of liquid cases which were not reflecting anything before.\n\nollj - Oops, yes PI was defined twice as I had left a copy of the distance function from one of my very old shaders (Chains and Gears) pasted in there. The RotateX() etc. functions were all part of that code too but were unused. Yes the \"stack\" is now more of a queue. I kept its name as it started out as a stack and I didn't rename it when the usage changed. \"no clue why you think a stack is needed were accumulators would have done nicely\" - well, because that would not handle ray branching from reflection and refraction at each intersection which was what I was investigating in this shader.

I figured someone would eventually emulate a recursively raymarched scene on a stack... unless someone else on here has already done it. It compiles and runs at 10fps on my oldest computer, which is pretty good for that machine. \n\nWith multiple ray examples, I've been taking the easy way out and avoiding recursion altogether by only performing reflection when refraction isn't possible. On abstract scenes, you can almost get away with it. I've tried to do things properly at the first intersection, then launch into the loop on the refractive pass, but that doesn't look quite right either. Either way, there are always performance issues... Of course, it's all relative.

I was curious to see how close you can get to original image and what the basis texture would or should look like if you can do full search and don't do anything fancy afterwards. Well, that test tool like 20-30 min of C coding. The answer - you can get super close.\n\nA lot of time was spent on trying to make it actually work in the shader. First draft took maybe 5 min, only compiled in browsers with DX11 backends, ran at 5 fps in a small window and then crashed my GTX Titan when I hit full screen  The rest was iterative approach of optimizing it so it doesn't run out of uniform constants and fails to compile on DX9 and native OpenGL backends, runs at high frame rates.\n\nAlso I took some time investigating different error estimators. MSE in sRGB did 90% of the job but had really bad failures because it is not aware of structures our visual system is sensitive to. But even things like SSIM fail. So I build a list of best candidates with different techniques and then selected them by hand (eye) manually.\n\nIt took a while but I learned a lot \n\nThe next obvious step is to find some procedural basis.",

Way before iDate+tunnel suffers from precision problems, the texture interpolation unit, which works in fixed point and at a relatively small precision, is already lacking bits/decimals. When you divide iDate.w by 10 and the shader looks better is not because you are helping with precision in the floating point arithmetic, but because the UVs are smaller and the HW interpolator has more room for subtexel lerp-ing. You can check this by simply replacing the texture lookup with a sine pattern/wave.\n\nIn any case, the shader needs to be seen at early in the morning ^_^",

(wall, tiles, whatever it is) Anyway, the first texture was lit from the perfect direction so it seems like there is a real displacement in the tunnel.\n\nBtw, there is one problem with using iDate.w in your code. As the day goes by, iDate.w can be relatively large number (for a float). And adding a large number to a small number such as .2/lenght(p) leads to errors. That's why the tunnel is not so nice at large speeds later in a day, especially near the right edge of the screen (where the length is larger) - the texture sampling is affected by this error, and you get blocky edges. So it's another reason why multiplying iDate.w with .1 is a good idea. I tested your program with constants and the rendering looks nice up to about 8000 (seconds). After that the error kicks in. Fortunately, when we divide by 10 it's enough to keep it in such range throughout the day.\n\nI especially like it this way:\n... vec2(atan(p.y,p.x),.2/dot(p,p))+iDate.w*.1 )*length(p);\nIt is brighter, and it doesn't matter if you watch it in the morning or late at night.

What scattering coefficient is considered \"correct\" for pbr clouds? I'm using single scattering and assuming that albedo is close to 1 (using same coefficients for absorption and inscattering). But I can't seem to find a clearly stated: hey, cloud material has these coefficients for (r, g, b) scattering. So far keeping it as (.6, .6, 1.) seemed about right to me but it's haunting me. (these are per meter * density of ray travel)",

It shouldn't matter if your computer is a little slower, that should only affect how fast the shader runs (and if it's slow, you can press 2/3/4 to improve the framerate). If it doesn't load correctly, though, it means there's a bug somewhere. Updating the GPU drivers or browser might help, but of course it's also possible the bug is in the shader. It's hard to say where the issue might be without seeing it myself/being able to reproduce it (since there's a lot of code in here), but in the end, though, it's just a silly shader, so you're not missing much if you've already seen the video",

For a Descent shader, which I may or may not have considered writing, I might go with quaternions, at least for storage. I've already used up pretty much all my Shadertoy time for this decade, though... \n\nAs for the >30x perf delta on Intel (Cherry Trail/Graphics Gen8 at least), if I were to guess, I'd say it's probably an instance of shader constant waterfalling/serialization, due to the different storage choices for raw vs struct-wrapped constant arrays (registers vs memory).

All in all, current version is about 2.8X as fast, so it *should* run well on lower-end GPU's (famous last words). I've only done some very brief testing on an integrated GPU from the blue team and results didn't seem to agree with my back-of-the envelope math, though, so if you happen to have access to an entry-level GPU (or maybe a high end Apple GPU), I'd appreciate the info \n\nBTW, when I say brush partition, I mean a simple flat list of bounding volumes and associated primitive ranges, which I suppose could be called a BVL - it's basically a flattened BVH. For a while I actually had both types implemented, with a macro to switch between implementations. The BVH was very similar to stubbe's shader, but much shallower (due to compile time constraints), and macro'd to fit in just a couple of lines. After I managed to optimize the BVL compile time significantly, though, I removed the BVH code entirely - I might still bring it back, but only if I come up with another traversal scheme.\n\nFinally, with all the changes I've made so far, I figured it might be pretty cool to be able to compare the current version to the initial one. So, if you'd rather play 'spot the difference' (instead of reading walls of text describing incremental changes), you can do so here.",

I did end up touching most of the brushes, but I've been careful not to affect the playable area in any way. As you can see in the changelog, I actually got carried away for a bit with the optimizations, and ended up reverting some changes when I realized that the teleporter platform in the Easy hallway had been affected. The outside area (visible only with NOCLIP 1 in Buffer A) was changed significantly, and for some reason I'm not totally happy even with that, since it might give the wrong impression - real maps are never this tidy in non-playable areas, especially when you know there's a compiler that will remove the geometry anyway. At the end of the day, the lower brush/plane count and the shorter encoding for the axial planes were a good trade-off, though.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the biggest deviation right now has to be the texturing. I'd like to have another go at it (it's still on the TODO list), but I'm not very confident I can make it significantly better. We'll see...\n\nAnyway, I'm done rambling... for now",

        "adx, 2018-10-20So... it's been a while - I think an update might be in order.\n\nI've been keeping a pretty detailed changelog in the main (Image) buffer - maybe too detailed, since many changes are minor... I'm tempted to trim it down to just the highlights, but for now I think it'll stay as is, maybe someone will find it useful/entertaining in some way. Anyways, here's the TL;DR version:\n\n- Collision map/detection/handling: this is probably the biggest change. I was hoping to come up with a nice, clean implementation. I haven't: corners have been cut, shortcuts have been taken, steps have been skipped - calling it an over-epsilonned kludgy mess would be very generous...  On a more serious note, the code does get the job done: there's wall-sliding, smooth stair climbing, ramp sliding and jumping. The acceleration/friction code is more simplistic than Quake's, but other than that the handling feels pretty close. Performance isn't horrible, at least compared to the actual map rendering.\n\n- Temporal super-sampling: added to cut down the ambient occlusion noise, but it also plays nicely with Unreal-style UV dithering. With TSS_USE_LUMA_DIFF 0 (Buffer D), USE_UV_DITHERING 1 and UV_DITHER_STRENGTH 1.0 (Buffer C) you get something that looks a lot like bilinear filtering, if you're into that sort of thing; add LOD_DITHER 1.0 (Buffer C) and you get trilinear - all still for the low price of a single unfiltered texture sample (and some extra divergence).\n\n- Functional weapon model: another step towards some actual gameplay\n\n- Lighting should be pretty close to Quake with gamma 0.9 now; gamma 1.0 would look too dark against the default (bright) Shadertoy background.\n\n- Fireball particle trail: not particularly impressive, but it really makes the map feel more alive, IMO.\n\n- Pain effects and underwater screen distortion when falling in the lava pit: don't fall, I guess? \n\nOther than that, I've also optimized the brushwork a bit (almost 25% fewer brushes/planes, with no visible changes to the playable area) and its encoding (whole map data fits in 85 lines now) and tidied up the outside geometry (which would normally not be seen with a BSP-based renderer). And speaking of BSP's, I've actually added (some) BSP support to my map processing tool, but the shader experiments didn't go very well - I managed to lock up my system twice while compiling a BSP fork of this shader. After that experience I didn't really want to continue down that path - sorry, laptop/tablet(/phone?) users! Maybe I'll give it another try for Quake 2...\n\nThere's another item on the TODO list that didn't quite make it - the zombies. The best model I could come up with (without blowing up the compile time budget for Buffer B) looked like a wooden mannequin, and without a really good zombie texture I don't think it would've worked. After switching the SDF normal estimation from central differencing to backward differencing compile time for Buffer B did drop by a couple of seconds - maybe there's enough room in there now for a more complicated model. For the time being, though, I'm putting the zombies on hold and I'll try to add some actual gameplay instead. To that end, I might have to do some compile-time optimizations in Buffer A, where persistent state is handled - it takes about 14 seconds now, half of the total compile time on my (admittedly ancient) CPU. I've already done some digging, and the low-hanging fruit there seems to be the function generating the QUAKE text above the Normal hallway. Optimizing it won't be pretty, but it could shave off a second or two.\n\nThere's probably more I could bore you with, but this is already getting pretty long and rambly. Maybe I'll honor the long-standing tradition of people who've done something once and write a blog post about all this...",

        "adx, 2018-08-20Thanks again for all the comments, everyone, looks like we all have fond memories of those days. \n\nA note on performance: while I know a GTX 1060 is capable of 144 fps at 800x450 with ~40% utilization, I'm also well aware of the situation on integrated/low end GPUS. The framerate I had on my underpowered DX4 wasn't really on the list of things I wanted to recreate, so I've already made some changes to reduce the compile time for Buffer B (where the ray-tracing/marching happens), in preparation for adding what's still missing: an acceleration structure and, of course, zombies! I'm still not really sure the BSP traversal won't blow up the compile times way out of proportion (on Windows, at least), but I'd like to give it a try, anyway. No promises, though, limited time and all.\n\nOh, and speaking of compile times - for anyone who wants to experiment with different code constructs, to see which is faster, I've made a quick-and-dirty Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script that hooks the Shadertoy lib and reports the time it takes to do the initial compilation (on page load) and subsequent manual ones.\n\n@theGiallo: Fun fact - the map file I'm using to generate the data in this shader is called groundhog.map, since the only thing you can do is teleport/start over. Those teleporters are essential \n\n@valentin: Reverse-bait-and-switch working as intended, then! Fewer people will probably click on the thumbnail, but those who do get a pleasant surprise.

        "adx, 2018-08-17Thanks for the kind words, guys  TBH I wasn't quite sure what kind of feedback to expect, given the stupendously high quality bar here, on shadertoy, and the relatively low ratio of creative coding to plain old plumbing of this shader. Not to mention that, as you can definitely tell, I'm a total noob when it comes to procedural generation... I tried to at least not half-ass it, though, so, while it's still obviously coder art, it's at least .75-assed coder art \n\n@Shane: Indeed, it was a fair bit of work for a shader, but it was a labor of love  The shadertoy workflow (with its instant feedback and zero setup boilerplate) was quite addictive at first - IMO it's the perfect mix of creative freedom with just a hint of (stimulating) technical limitations. The superlinear compile times kind of curbed my enthusiasm after a while, but there are still a few things I'd like to try. And yeah, it's amazing how far we've come in terms of sheer computing power - from not being able to do a single perspective division per pixel to casually intersecting >1000 planes! I guess it's good to live in the future \n\n@Dave: I don't think I can take credit for either of those things - I may have peeked at the vkQuake underwater screen warp code, and I may have gotten very friendly with the Gimp color picker (percentage mode FTW) and Trenchbroom screenshots. At some point I may have even disabled f.lux after realising that doing texturing work at night might not be such a good idea... Anyway, I'm glad you like the end result",

That said, likely any performance difference here (I can measure none) is thanks to the simplification of the expressions (good job!) but not involving branching.\n- AMD has register selection instruction, Nvidia has conditional move instruction, both are SIMD and branchless.  The code computes both sides of the conditional and then selects the correct one.  Using arithmetic to select values just wastes FMA ops.\n- Branching allows a thread to skip code (advance the program counter) only when all fragments in the thread agree on having no use for that condition.  There's nothing much more costly about this than unconditionally never skipping the code who's results might not be used, it's just an extra \"jump if all values in vector are zero\" instruction.\n\nWhy I point this out is that here, in this shader, with or without USE_BRANCHLESS_DDA, there is no major divergence forcing any fragments in a thread to be useless for extended periods of time.  getVoxel remains always fully parallel between fragments.\n\nAs someone pointed out, breaking the loop after a solid voxel is found is a useful optimization.  It is in fact deliberately using branching to finish earlier: nearby fragments often complete their loops after similar numbers of iterations, when the scene surface encountered spans across these fragments.  Fragments which are physically nearby in the image (grouped by small rectangles) are placed together into each GPU thread for specifically this reason.",

(or you accidentally made some great function you never dreamed of)\nbut if your function is symmetrical, you will notice that more and more things cancel each other out easily, while you substitute in all the directions. practice builds intuition.\n\nthe core goal is the identity: sign(a)*sign(a)=1. ,to substitute forwards to. anything that becomes 0 or 1 (or +-0.5).\nSadly you can not always rely on a/a=1. within IEEE float types. division by 0 more likely makes your code incompatible.\n\nthis makes more sense applied to more symmetrical functions, where a branch has 2 paths with roughly equal and very simple arithmetic. it also makes more sense to make code branchless that uses few variables, and to not have loops with many iterations return parameters into branchless code. \n\nBranchless code should be \"low level routines\", and the mainImage() branches can easily stay \"if()else\". You substitute till you get just that, a \"binary tree\" where everything is evenly branched, a perfect garden where you know that you can not remove anything more, the dream of an OpenCL coder.",

Currently trying to find a way to fix this as it's much better to know exactly what the end user sees.\n\nAlso there are several other magic values that will work. Also working on those.\nfloat grid_position = fract( dot( fragCoord.xy, vec2(1.0/16.0,10.0/36.0) + 0.093 ) ); for example also works fine.\nFrom messing about with the magic values for mine I can also find patterns that looks very similar to valves dither which tells me that the two methods are related - I think mine has better magic values though. They use a different method for chromatic - I might experiment here but my current method of ensuring one component goes down in value when the two others go up and vice versa works well.\nOut of the methods on display here mine is still my favorite. Second favorite is chromatic blue noise. Note that mine is chromatic by default. To see a non-chromatic version of it change line 172 to :\nvec3 dither_shift_RGB = vec3(dither_shift, dither_shift, dither_shift); //non-chromatic dithering",

        "CeeJayDK, 2014-05-28It shifts some pixels towards green and some towards purple. It looks odd here because you reduce the number of colors so the banding is exaggerated, but the idea is that instead of shifting the color of the pixel to one shade brighter or darker when dithering, you only shift one subpixel, thus you get a finer pattern. Like what sub-pixel anti-aliasing does for font-smoothing.\n\nYou can make the color shift more apparent by reducing the dither_bit value (for demonstration purposes - it should look best with a dither_bit of 8.0).\n\nI use green/purple because green is the color component that appears the brightest so I wanted to juxtapose that with the two other color components, (red and blue) which together make purple.\n\nYou can also use yellow/blue : (dither_shift, dither_shift, -dither_shift)\nor red/cyan : (dither_shift, -dither_shift, -dither_shift)\n\nor disable this feature with (dither_shift, dither_shift, dither_shift)\n\nAs for the diagonal dithering .. that's completely wrong. A bug introduced when I ported it from HLSL to GLSL incorrectly.\n\nI've tried fixing it and I think this is correct : \n\nfloat grid_position = fract( dot( gl_FragCoord.xy - vec2(0.5,0.5) , vec2(1.0/16.0,10.0/36.0) + 0.25 )  );\n\nThat should look far better than the buggy pattern.\n\nI also noticed a flaw in the original version (before porting). I normally the + 0.25 bit as a protection against precision problems, but it should be outside the dot() not inside it. This means this pattern (which still works) was created and tuned with this mistake in place, and so I should go back to my original code, correct that and see if there isn't an even better pattern I have overlooked.\n\nYou can create new patterns by playing with the vec2(1.0/16.0,10.0/36.0) part. New fractions give different patterns.\nI started with a simple checkerboard pattern :\nfloat grid_position = fract( dot( gl_FragCoord.xy - vec2(0.5,0.5) , vec2(1.0/2.0,1.0/2.0)  ) + 0.25 )",

In a normal code (not a shader) you don't need to compute any history, but in this case you loose a lot of interesting stuff for sure. But as long as you compose and tune everything for that it is ok.\nRunning IIR filter multiple times doesn't do much, in most cases it would be the same as running a single filter with a higher Q. It would basically amplify frequencies near the cutoff more.\nAs for FIR then it's a completely different filter by nature and it doesn't have any properties of IIR - it doesn't resonate. Running IIR filter the way it's done in this shader is not the same as running FIR filter of the same window size.\nThere are cases when you would prefer FIR filters like mixing, where you don't want any resonant properties and don't want to have any phase shift.",

By pure chance, I came up with an algorithm a while back that emulates 2nd order Voronoi in 3D. It's easy to use, the pattern quality is reasonably good, and it's fast enough to raymarch. I've explained it in my \"Cellular Tiled Tunnel\" example. The downside is animation. You can animate it, but it doesn't have the same feel. Incidentally, the edge detection in that particular example is rolled into the curvature calculation.\n\nThere are also countless other pseudo-random geometric surface patterns that look interesting. Triangle noise, fractal variations, repeat tiles, etc.",

However, if you take the comments away, there's not a great deal of code to this.\n\nA lot of things here have been faked for the sake of speed. For instance, I've used the object's geometry to offset the texture lookup just a little in order to trick the eyes into believing a little ray bending is occurring. The shiny reflective look is mainly caused by two things; The specular lighting and the fake environment mapping. All work together to give it a bit of a perspex\\glass kind of feel. The edging and contrasty palette give it a slight comic effect. If you look at the code, you'll see that each component only takes up a few lines.\n\nBy the way, I'll do a more realistic glass related example at some stage.",

I haven't done the detailed investigation to know this for sure - to do that, I'd do visualizations of the output volumes of each layer of the network, to see what the intermediate representations are - but the big tell is those high freqency artifacts on the surface of the bunny, if it was using its low frequency features ideally it wouldn't need those high frequency ones.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10739.pdf it might be interesting to try a network like this, one where the sinusoidal is on the input rather than as an activation function. that allows regularizing the number of sinusoidal inputs you need: for the first layer, initially start too wide, eg 16 or 32 or even more fourier features, and use model compression style regularization to set input connections to zero - l1+fading-in soft-l0, no l2, sample n nonzero weights per output column on the input matrix each training example - outputting to an 8-wide output. that gives you input feature selection. then, feed that through some number of 4x4 mults to a few different activation functions. might also be worth looking at trying multi-bias. at least one of the activation functions should probably be something smooth like sigmoid or tanh or smoothstep or something else that provides additional smoothness in the mid layers, also probably pow(relu(x), 2.) or something would help with distance calculation. in other words - use operations that have a similar shape to what is typically used in shaders (just a few branches and distance calculations), and evaluate it in a space that allows it to select its position representation. that should allow compressing more. if you really want to spend compute on it, one could try automl, I'm not up to date on what options there are for serious automl for tiny networks like this but the full-space output supervision means there's a good shot at evolving an efficient network.\n\nThen, once you have that working, you could then train a network like this for every pose of a model and initially give it massively overcomplete input representation of concat(fourier_features(model_pose_state), fourier_features(3dnearest_2d_texel_pos), fourier_features(model_space_xyz)) and use the initial regularized matrix to feature-select out of those, and then evaluate it in screenspace to sdf-trace through a higher resolution version of the model in the implicit space of the neural network. If done right this should allow combining an actual mesh model and texture with a neural SDF upsampler, thereby allowing faking much higher resolution detail than a texture bumpmap otherwise allows. though, maybe you'd need to tell it the relative position in a texel, and feed it one texel to give it information on what kind of upsampling to do in that texel. or maybe you'd need to give it the four adjacent texels as input and have it figure out if it needs to use them? it also really depends on your final compute budget, but my hope is that this allows compressing models enough to render them on lower end devices, which means using a low res texture and the tiniest model manageable. if you're instead going to use a high res texture, then an option might be to use entirely different weights in different regions of the texture, thereby completely replacing the concept of bump map textures.",

Mathematically they are the same. \u2207 (f)\u00c2\u00b7L = \u2207L(f).\n\nIn the context of 1k raymarched intros, where every byte counts and expectations on lighitng are low, it's even better, because, by definition, f(x)=0 at the intersection point, so you can compute your gradient/derivative with only one evaluation of f:\n\n\u2207L(f) \u2250 [f(x+\u03b5L) - f(x)]/\u03b5 = f(x+\u03b5L)/\u03b5\n\nThere's such example here: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsfGzM\n\nAs for the texture trick, yep, Dave_Hoskins and I iterated on this at some point in the past. The blue and alpha channel are a second independent signalof white noise offset by the same (37,17) amount. As you imagine the trick is cool because all the data you need is in the same texel, so not only you do less reads but more also trash the cache a lot less.",

So obvious that you need a periodic function to deal with values that are limited to a specific range, such as angles. The solution is elegant, so I'll add it.\n\nHowever I don't want the flare to animate based on time. The flare is meant to actually be used as a flare and you'll get weird shimmering if you're standing still and have plugged time into the noise function. So I added flare position instead of time as it was before.",

This one is exceptionally nice - I can see you've even gone through the trouble to triple up for the chromatic effect. I noticed a seem line in the main flare object. Don't quote me on this, but I think it's due to the fact that the value \"ang\" won't wrap unless you run it through a sinusoidal term.\n\nIn other words, \"noise(ang*k)\" wouldn't wrap, but \"noise(sin(ang*k + t))\" would... I'm pretty sure that's the case, but I'm not willing to bet money on it. \n\nJust as an example, something like the following should work:\n\nf0 = f0 + f0*(sin(noise(sin(ang*2. - iTime/2.)*4.0 - cos(ang*3. + iTime/2.))*16.)*.1 + dist*.1 + .8);\n\nOf course, that wouldn't work in with the aesthetics, but I'd imagine that a tweaked version would.",

Also TDM's trick makes it more water like. There is no subsurface scattering here.\n\n@Shane\nGood point, for large pos.z factor the reflection is very biased. Your solution with \"normalize(nor - normalize(rd + .5)*.2)\" looks nice, but sometimes I feel that reflection is too bright. Nevertheless I think your solution is better, in case of tunnels, since it is not dependent on position.\nAs of using texture based noise, indeed it is faster, but unfortunately in case of this shader I get too much banding. It is almost always a tradeof qulity vs speed.\nBTW I like very much your shaders with a lot of descriptions. Good work, man!",

Just a minor thing, but with regards to the additional specular lighting trick, I was wondering what will happen as the z-position component (pos.z) gets sufficiently large? If the object is to offset the normal in a random, contour-like (?) way, would something like \"normalize(nor - normalize(rd + .5)*.2),\" or similar, work? Either way, it looks cool, so I'm going to keep it in mind. \n\nI've made a few \"tunnel through noise\" examples. Although, two levels is the absolute most I can get running at full frame rate on my slower machine, and that's with IQ's fast, textured version. Because value noise has a voxelized feel, I find that a squarish tunnel blends in a little better... Not perfectly, but better.\n\nIn theory, I guess it'd be possible to set various cube corners to zero in the noise function, set up a spline curve and do it that way, but I have a feeling that'd be more trouble than it's worth.",

See the KEY_ constants and the functions KeyIsPressed() and KeyIsToggled(). In Shadertoy there is a special texture \"Keyboard\" which if I remember correctly is a 256 x 3 texture where the x co-ordinate is a keycode to lookup and the y co-ordinate is what you want to query about the key. y=0 tests if the key is currently pressed, y=1 is the \"debounced\" keypress (i.e. is this the first frame the key was pressed) and y = 2 reads a state bit which is flipped each time the key is pressed.

Although, I usually go for something cheap and subtle with a range. \"if(abs(d)<.001*(t*.125 + 1.) || t>FAR) break;\" -- I use that one a lot when I need to cover a bit of distance, since you can often get away with less precision with more distant objects.\n\nThe code here is reasonably sound, but it was based on routines I'd written long before posting the example on Shadertoy -- Back when GPUs were slow, which meant taking shortcuts that you wouldn't take today. I usually try to make a note of it in the comments. Either way, I've been meaning to post a cleaner, more up-to-date version of this, so I'll put it on my list of things to do.",

Amazing that it's sat there for years unnoticed. I'll comment the line out. In fact, I'll take it all out to avoid confusion. You'll note that in examples I've written since, I don't take that step. One thing that I tend to implement to alleviate popping is checking for the absolute distance, just in case the ray traverses too far into the surface... It doesn't always work, but you'd be amazed at how often it helps.\n\nAnother thing to note is the high surface hit threshold of \".005.\" I used to raymarch stuff before this site went up -- when computers were still pretty slow, so a common threshold today -- like \".001\" -- that required more iterations was considered a luxury. It needs to be lowered, but I might leave it there for posterity. In fact, this example needs a revamp. I might put together a more polished trapezoidal noise version.",

Basically, I'll try a cheaper short-cut version, then hope that it looks OK.\n\nIn this particular instance, the refracted imagery is a good example. In reality, you'd have to restrict some kind of moving viscous membrane to the tubes, then perform a whole heap of refractive and reflective bounces whilst gathering up material properties - which isn't possible in realtime with the average computer. Therefore, I've settled for indexing a refracted ray at a uniform length into a viscous like function and leaving it at that. The weird thing is that our brain expects to see a certain result based on the scene, does the calculations anyway, and distorts the membrane to suit the result. It's far from perfect (transparency is lacking), but our minds will vaguely accept it.\n\nIn addition, I saved a lot of distance calculations by tweaking the raymarching loop, bump mapping the cellular walls, doing some fake, localized shadowing, etc. Bump mapping the finer details is one of the oldest tricks in the book and always worth the trouble, if you can get away with it.",

However, smoothly combining a perturbed cyclinder with the gyroid surface - plus some tweaking - can produce a pretty interesting multiple tunnel system. I did something similar in my \"Abstract Island Cavern\" example. The downside with some transcendental surfaces, such as these, is honing difficulty, which is why the raymarching loop look so hacky. There are probably better ways to address the issue, but none that I'm clever enough to come up with. \n\n@Dave and @Virgill\nI slowed the camera down to half the speed. Any slower than that, and people would begin to realize that just how much fake physics is included.  As for the FOV, I agree that it's a little restrictive.

This imagery is unique, but draws upon geometrical elements from common patterns - Hexagonal mazes, Truchets, isometric cubes, impossible geometry, etc. Anyway, I put this up hoping others would create some really interesting patterns that I might learn something from.\n\nFor anyone not quite familiar with the concepts in this shader, the knowlege could be assimilated in an afternoon - since it's nothing more than applying some basic geometry and very rudimentary Photoshop layering techniques. Geometrically speaking, some circular and hexagonal shape portions are placed at certain spots on a hexagonal grid cell, which is pretty easy.\n\nThe rest is application of fundamental steps that the average Photoshop user is familiar with. Render a masked shape layer, apply borders, drop shadows, bevels, etc. In WebGL pixel shader terms, that is just is just a case of correctly applying the \"smoothstep\" function, manipulating distance fields, applying gradients, and so forth.",

I will check this.\n\nFor the patchwork transparency, It's in fact glow discretized into voxel cubes.\nYou can see on this shader https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltKBWR that glow is an accumulation factor: the more iteration you have with a ray the more glow you have if distances are small. On this shader it mainly accumulates when rays are almost parallel to the surface (more iterations with small distances).\nGlow is mixed with the color of the surface, so it appears like a transparent halo, you can see through the glow, like a translucent peel.\nWe are in voxelized space (3D space divided into \"big\" cubes), so this glow is still there but appears as cubes instead of smooth surface.\nThe sphere shader, but in voxel space:\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/llKBWR",

Usually that is solved with slow and non-local solvers, that discretize space.

Otherwise, just subtracting NaN from NaN would produce NaN. (unfortunately, I don't know how to see final shader assembly on mac and check that...)\nThat's probably why on mac mini those \"o -= o - X\" doesn't work. It's possible that compiler can't figure out that it could just \"clear c\" and then subtract X, but it rather subtract X from o (getting NaN), and then subtract the result from o (again getting NaN).\nWhen it is written explicitly as \"o = o - o + X\" then it is probably detected and optimised into clearing of c and adding X which gets rid of the NaN.",

The white glow effect is also applied there to tiles and the gaps that are not lit up. The \"marching\" cube was animated using if statements to transform it based on the time, and lit using three point lights that only take direction, and not distance into account.

Shaders can be great teaching tools, but if you write code like @FabriceNeyret2, it destroys readability and removes the benefits of shaders for no benefit.

What I really need to do is hook it up to a database, etc... but it's easier just to direct visitors to IQ's material, or here.\n\nAs for VR integration, I remember it's just a simple matter of applying a certain function to the screen coordinates and offsetting the camera's X-position left and right accordingly... It's been a while. Either way, a fast moving scene with objects flying past the camera would be well suited to it.\n\n@asneakyfatcat\nI like that Mandelbrot orbit trap example of yours.",

Hyperbolic all the things!\n\nShane, [appoloneus of perga] was great with first derivatives of quadratic functions, but lacked comprehension of (ancient times) calculus to do 2nd derivatives of cubics, which made him good in circle-packing and coplanar math but limited at conic sections, parabola, frustum culling, and 3d to 2d projections.\n\nthe trick to fast (pseudo) circle packing (that is modulated and not necessarily an iterated fractal like this shader, for performance) is to define a triangle lattice of simplexes, in 2d, 3d, 4d,5d,and its especially useful in 8d, and then take a lower dimensionally shadow/hyperslice (in 2d or 3d) of it. (for starters: a planar slice trough a 3d simplex lattice of stacked spheres, then you rotate and move the plane of the slice to change it, the more domains the more weird it gets, 8d spherepacking has special super-symmetry to exploit here!).\nas basis for this tri-lattice use\nfloat F=0.36602540378;//sqrt(3.)*.5-.5\nfloat G=0.21132486540;//(sqrt(3.)*.5-.5)/sqrt(3.)-.5-(.5/sqrt(3.))\nfloat TAU=6.28318530718;\n//https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xs2fRd  \n//to interpolate between square and tri-lattice a lot of hashes are nice for both extrema, but discontinuous for any in-between.\nvec2 skew(vec2 p){float f=(p.x+p.y)*F;return p+vec2(f,f);}\nvec2 unskew(vec2 q){float g=(q.x+q.y)*G;return q-vec2(g,g);}\n\nan advanced approach uses aperiodic iterations over modulated lattices, with domain folds of more domains down to less domains. if comes down to 2x3 and 3x2 matrices (and their spheremapped-pseudoo-inverses), and lots of loop accumulating.",

As you might notice already sampleBSDF function returns hit information including material, normal and so on and inside loop I use 2 structs to store data for current and next event.

The first one is simple, it's just the perspective trick for the penrose triangle and I added a little bit of an extra overhang on one end for the AO calculation, I learned that from the yx penrose shader.\n\nThe second trick is the voronoi crumble. In order to get it to be continuous I first rotate the coordinate space so that the x and y directions are parallel to the camera plane, then for the z dimension I use the ray length relative to the first time it hits the outer part of the triangle, that way the length passed to the voronoi will be the same regardless of how far back it is. This causes issues with the normal calculation which I was sorta able to fix but in the end I just used iteration shading anyway to cover it up. \n\nThe third trick is for the moving blocks, I do the same as with the voronoi crumble where I rotate space so the x and y are parallel for the camera, then I rotated them perpendicular to the sides of the triangle and everytime they pass the half way point they get teleported super far behind or super far infront of the triangle so it looks like they rotate around it. \n\n@tdhooper, the convincing part is probably because I used a different distance metric for the voronoi max(p.x,max(p.y,p.z)) instead of length(p)",

That led to me wasting 10 minutes tweaking, and I came up with this, which goes at the end: \n\nfloat bw = (col.r+col.g+col.b)/3.; // light value\ncol -= bw; // pure colour values\ncol *= 0.8; // desaturate\ncol += vec3(.2,.2,-.2)*(bw-.4); // add yellow to bright areas, blue to shadows\n    \ngl_FragColor = vec4( col+bw, 1.0 ); // add colour to light\n\nIt's not right still, but I figured it's worth posting up. You can get a nice daylight tone curve (blue shadows, yellow highlights), desaturate a little, and change brightness/contrast if you want (\"bw = (bw-0.5) * 0.8 + 0.5;\" will drop the contrast).",

I know it's not your job to teach this stuff and understand if you don't have the time or interest to respond, but any help would be appreciated!\n\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n\tvec2 p = (2.0*fragCoord-iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y;\n    vec2 offsetLeft = vec2(p.x + 0.5, p.y);\n    vec2 offsetRight = vec2(p.x - 0.25, p.y-0.2);\n\tfloat d1 = sdCircle(offsetLeft,0.15);\n    float d2 = sdCircle(offsetRight,0.15);\n    \n\t// coloring\n    vec3 col1 = vec3(1.0) - sign(d1)*vec3(0.9,0.1,0.7);\n    vec3 col2 = vec3(1.0) - sign(d2)*vec3(0.9,0.1,0.7);\n    col1 *= 1.0 - exp(-3.0*abs(d1));\n    col2 *= 1.0 - exp(-3.0*abs(d2));\n\t// col *= 0.8 + 0.2*cos(150.0*d);\n\tcol1 = mix( col1, vec3(1.0), 1.0-smoothstep(0.0,0.01,abs(d1)) );\n    col2 = mix( col1, vec3(1.0), 1.0-smoothstep(0.0,0.01,abs(d2)) );\n\tfragColor = vec4(col1 * col2,1.0);\n}",

However, a lot of the most interesting imagery associated with the subject tends to involve a simple icosahedron and its dual, the dodecahedron, each of which I'm sure you're familiar with. Essentially, working with the objects involves the same process: Produce the object, identify the local face position, vertices, edge midpoints, etc, then take it from there.",

That distributes the teeth contacts uniformly across all possible tooth pairs, which in turn ensures that the erosion that happens over years of usage gets also distributed evenly, so the gears get working as smoothly as possible for the longest time. For example, in these steam machines, this gear has 13 teeth and this other one has 31.",

I'll just chime in and mention (because I have professionally written code to produce engineering-accurate gear splines) that the \"proper and correct\" tooth shape is known as an involute curve. For gears it's the curve formed by a point moving along a rotating line which is tangent to a circle. This produces contact points between the teeth with parallel surface normals, so friction is applied uniformly (and the gears don't intersect or miss each other). See here. In my work I approximated the curve with a bezier.\n\nThe shader is awesome anyway and the synth code is really nice and simple.

The one I went with was a G(3, 0) icosahedral Goldberg arrangement, but for all I know, there might be better ones. I took a space folding approach, which drastically cut down on rendering, but never explored whether it was an option for the...  rhombicuboctahedron (I think) arrangement here. \n\nBy the way, I remember getting the gears to interlock a little more by tapering the gear and teeth radii according to the spherical depth, but using cones to set a maximum bound would probably work better.",

And I guessed that Pressure = up+down+right+left and that velocity = (right-left , up-down). Advection is the same as always - step w/ the velocity (in this case calculated from u/d/l/r. Pressure exchange I guessed was just exchanged on each boundary with the corresponding internal direction : left-boundary: right energy enters from left etc. acceleration is always the gradient of pressure, but acceleration increases the difference between antiparallel energies - which is the calculation for velocity. \n\nSo I totally guessed at how to do it based on my experience - idk if it corresponds to other algorithms... I just kind of intuitively put the pieces together until it looked right. \n\nBut it doesn't correspond to MeAndMyNeighborhood other than the advection step. But the feeling behind it is totally the same.  Translation, Free Energy exchange, Acceleration=grad(Pressure)\n\nThere are some things that I can do with this algorithm that I cannot do with the other. For example, on line 32 in Buffer A, I slowly mix the distribution values with the calculated pressure - which is like internal viscosity or something? idk I was just messing around, but that's like a weird thing I couldn't do before by tracking velocity and pressure separately. \n\nSo by defining Lattice Boltzmann as a fluid algorithm that uses distribution values instead of velocity and pressure, this totally is, but if you're comparing it to something other people have done... well in that case I have no clue.",

When you remove that section, or change it to \"#if 0\", the jelly cloth starts falling freely. Personally, I like to use \"if (false) /*newline*/{...}\", because it doesn't use the pre-processor and you can easily enable/disable the code by commenting out the line containing \"if (false)\", or make it dynamic by using a variable instead of a literal.\n\nYes, this algorithm is based on verlet integration (update only uses two latest positions and acceleration). However, the cloth constraints are solved using a simple relaxation technique (move points 10% in the direction enforced by each constraint). Also note, that thanks to verlet integration, the corrections performed by the constraints implicitly change the velocity.\n\nAbout the next step, this is one of the most impressive cloth on shadertoy: curtain and ball",

The raymaching loop has in the order of a hundred \"map\" calls, whereas bump mapping tends to involve about four.\n\nYou seem to know your way around differential geometry, etc, so if you're not familiar with bump mapping (texture or function form), I'm pretty sure you'll figure it out. Either way, I have examples everywhere that are pretty easy to drop into code.\n\nIt also helps to have a bunch of cliche functions in your head that are cheap, but visually effective. In this case, it's also possible to store detailed terrain in a buffer, since GPUs these days tend to be pretty efficient when reading texel values. I use that technique in several shaders on here.",

As an exercise, I tried to make a Lipschitz friendly (for want of a better description) terrain with a tunnel running through it. I think I managed to do it, but the second I started smoothing things, adding interesting features, etc - which tends be aesthetically necessary - things would break down. Either way, it made me realise that I should at least attempt to create surfaces that are easier to hone in on.\n\n@iq\nNice is relative, of course.

In regard to anticipating the pitch ahead of time, sometimes that can cause trouble when the sinusoidal path frequency is too high, so I've left that as is. Either way, I could probably add one or two layers of terrain noise to the camera motion to give the impression that more of the underlying terrain is being anticipated.\n\nOn a side note, moving a camera along a path only adds a few lines here and there, so I'm surprised that more people don't apply it.\n\n@antonOTI\nThat scenery is pretty freaky. If someone rendered it in shader form (definitely doable), I'd think the chasm looked a little boxy.  I'm going to try to get to Iceland and Greenland within the next year...

The \"abs(d)<.001*(1. + t*const)\" was my particular tweak, and I've used it on various examples for years. I didn't use it here because I didn't want to confuse matters beyond necessary. Also, tweaks along those lines can sometimes effect reflections, depending on the situation.\n\nSome of my examples were written years ago, and were sometimes based on code written years before that. Reflections, even five years ago (almost to the day) could really slow things down, and there were so many weird things that could ruin performance. These days, I'd probably recommend some of my later reflection examples as templates, since GPUs can handle nesting and branching much better. In fact, come to think of it, I might put up a 2020 version... Actually, nothing in 2020 has turned out good, so I might wait until 2021.",

However, the reason I stuck to just two passes for this particular example was for reasons, as you mentioned, noise.\n\nAs for the temporal filter, this has the cheapest one available, a swiftly moving camera.  Seriously, though, the still-frame antialiasing you see when you hit pause is always a little on the disappointing side. You'll also notice that more shadow iterations (only 16 are used) are necessary.\n\nI've seen people apply a single-pass, geometric, edge filter, then take out the noise in the hot spots. It kind of works, and it's definitely faster than antialiasing the whole thing, but it's still not quite the same.",

This likely ends up as a game that can do good visuals (with surreal isometric tiles), but still focuses its memory and processing power on good music instead.

You can do the same lighting effects. In fact, many raymarching shaders here in Shadertoy implement shadows (XsX3DB), ambient occlusion (lsX3DH), reflections (MdlGzn), refraction (lsXGzH), subsurface scattering (4dsGRl), motion blur (4slGzl), or global illumination (ldsGWB)",

I have two questions for you... 1) I've read your article about raymarching terrain but am looking for some more info on raymarching other objects (like a box for instance).  Do you have or plan on writing an article about that?  2) Can raymarching do refraction and reflection like raytracing can?  It seems like it ought to be able to, but it also seems like nobody does it in practice, why is that?",

My understanding is you just treat this as flattening the integral for a single light source.\n\nSo the trivial way to handle multiple lights would be to pick a light (via some CDF) first, then use a second random variable to pick along the ray for this light using equi-angular sampling.\n\nIf you have a lot of overlapping lights, you will probably get better results by multiple importance sampling between equi-angular sampling for all lights to combine all the pdfs.\n\nAs noted in the paper, if you have dense (usually meaning non-homogenous) media, you also get better results by still partly sampling using the scattering function alone (and of course use multiple importance sampling to combine with equi-angular sampling).",

See https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/hoffman/s2013_pbs_physics_math_notes.pdf for in depth description (also explains why EnvBRDFApprox uses a different angle).",

I modified the code to return fresnel term and was surprised to notice that I see only a solid base color instead of brightening of the base color along the edges of the geometry where the ndotv vectors approaches 0. When calculating the fresnel term with ndotv I see more of what I'd expect, which I see is an input into EnvBRDFApprox. \n\nAll this to ask why is fresnel calculated with ldoth or vdoth instead of ndotv or ndoth?",

        "ollj, 2017-08-01ideologies on text display:\n\nyes, using \"sprite sheets\" for anything is good for repetitive things, like glyphs.\n\nthe trick to text performance is tesselation, 1 tile per glyph, using pMod2() of hg_sdf, or something simpler with more constrains. the important part is to NOT make a loop like in a tesselated voronoi, and to NEVER care for neighbor glyphs for other reasons than typesetting linebreaks or non-uniform glyph widths (typesetting is done before printing).\n\nnon overlapping tiles == non overlapping glyphs result in much better performance. you should only have 1 glyph per frgment and address the tileID per a=uv.xy; fract(fract(a)*b+c)*d+e... glyphs should be as atomic as possible, like a toy-train-track that only allows 90deg turns, like lego blocks. note that they do not allow overlapping in 3d space, treat your shader like that. Glyphs may share the same subroutines, enveloped by transformations. Glyphs can be composed of smaller tesselated sub-glyphs. Glyphs may be defined as array of smaller sub-glyphs in a tesselation that is smaller than a glyph. 2 different glyphs may or may not share the same sub-tesselation. it may make sense to rotate a sub-tesselatio for glyphs with more diagonal lines.\nif a glyph is defined as array on a tesselation, it can modulo-shift on a grid that is smaller than the glyph.\n\nyou may chose to use multiple overlapping tesselations for seamless offsets or multy-layers, but this usually makes things less efficient. it makes more sense if one tesselation is scaled or offset differently from another tesselation:\n[url=https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xt23zG]4 offset ovrlapping tesselations[url]\n\nit is \"relatively\" easy to define non univorm tiles quadtree) without overlap for traversal or typesetting: the context of defining tand addressing them for typesetting may be tricky and novel extension to https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xs2czK\n\ntreat any glyph as a combining character on tiles where tiles to not overlap, but may have sub-tiles and transformations.\n\nYou then can tread a text as a glyph that is composed of an array of glyphs.",

All this is not necessarily bad though, its only risky if done so much that the compiler stack heap collides. and it can  increases compile time a bit\n.\nUnrolling loops (or otherwise transforming them) and using LUTs is the less memory efficient but faster run-time approach. It is being done 100% automatically since the early 90s. before that , loop optimization was a much more manual and explicit thing, and it was treasured for performance when you used sequences of modulo to reduce dome break or end conditions, calculating in bulks instead (early parallel/vector processing).\nA #define likely outperforms an equivalent function on run-time. because the processor more likely finds optimizations that can often be obfuscated by subroutines, or slowed down by branches and changing pointers. opengl is  lot about constructing and executing these 16x16 matrices doing multiple transformations in one cycle. this benefits from #define and loop unrolling.\n\nusing determinant() likely increases compile time and runtime. it is a  matrix multiplication optimized vector processor after all.",

For hardcoding things a bit I chose to only work with split patterns that lead to 4 children (ascii art in comment), and do at most 1 recursion. I split each root tile (COLOR_TILES to visualize) into 4 subregions, then pick at most 2 children, and split those into 4, then stop. It's just a tedious mini kdtree of some kind... Space is distorted with linear steps in some places to get some diagonal patterns + some randomized 90degrees rotations for variation.\n\nThere is a bit of extra obfuscating code for optimizing the marching with a bit of raytracing...",

See\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdXBD2\nstarting at line 295...\nfor my most recent collection of \"shadertoy famous irrational numbers\" with utility contexts and (some of) their trigonometric as well as sqt() identities.\nsuch as the ones listed in the bottom here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_trigonometric_constants\n\nThe most famous irrational numbers on shadertoy are ratios relevant for tri-hexagonal (or brick-octagonal) tessellations or honeycombs, only second to the 2 most irrational (slowest converging) numbers that include sqrt(5), phi=0.61 and Phi=1.61 for [p] where;\np-1=1/p\n\n----\n\nalmost identity is (heuristically speaking) close enough for most applications.\nshadertoy is mostly about fast good enough heuristic approaches.\noften you have the hard choice of defining \nconst shit 1/sqrt(3.) \nor any similar irrational root or fraction, or just save the processing power for 3 decimals of constant approximation, instead of getting 7.4 decimals of float precision.",

However, GPUs are strange creatures, so I can never be sure whether it's a faster method or not. I'd imagine taking the \"else if\" statements outside the main loop would help with things like compiling, and so forth, but who knows. Either way, this easily runs at 60 FPS on my machine, so I guess it's a moot point. \n\nAs for the blood, it'd be interesting to see what an extra reflective\\refractive pass would do, but as you mentioned, you were looking to keep things simple, and that'd definitely complicate things.",

Of course, the isolines become more prominent. Reducing the \"thD\" variable, tweaking the final loop line, increasing iterations, etc, makes things more concise, but at the expense of framerate.\n\nYou could also swap in a more forgiving distance field equation, etc, but I wanted to continue with Fabrice's repeat cube theme. By the way, replacing it with a Menger Cube, metaballs, etc, is pretty interesting.\n\nBy the way, I haven't tried it on this particular example, but it might look nicer using the weighted distribution thing, a la Cloudy Spikeball - and some of IQ's texture-based examples. Finally, if you had a fast computer, more sophisticated lighting looks interesting. I'm currently putting together a simple example that \"attempts\" to apply point lighting.",

The tile here uses just six strategically placed spheres, and under certain circumstances, you can get away with as few as four. Of course, you're not limited to just spheres.\n\nI know of a few ways to take the method further, but I'd be more interested in seeing your take on it.",

The ones that need it, can do it on their own, although it is very painful indeed, which is bad for the shader artists/creators.\n\nSo I think we should work on adding the ever wanted buffer controls to passes. These should be per pass, not per shader (again, a pass might need restart on resize, other passes on the same shader shouldn't). Other pass/buffer controls include frequency of refresh (once, on resize, every frame, every N frames, etc). A second iteration on that would be per buffer/pass pixel format options (unorm8 vs int v f16 v f32). And a third one would be custom resolution for each buffer/pass.\n\nWe've been a slow on implementing many of these features, but we should be able to put them up the priority list.",

        "Shane, 2023-02-23Thanks again, everyone. \"Shader Of The Week\" -- I was wondering why this was getting extra attention.  I was thinking the other day that Shadertoy easily has enough inventory these days to have a \"Shader Of The Day\", but I'm guessing preparing the front page every day would get tiresome for the creators pretty quickly -- I wouldn't want to do it. \n\nAnyway, this example was a half hearted attempt to create imagery with a Blender rendered feel. I haven't done it in a while, but I watch the occasional Blender tutorial. I'm always amazed by the sheer amount of work their artists put in, and how lazy my efforts look by comparison.  It's a bit hard to compete with a huge engine with endless assets and the luxury of rendering time, but I noticed a lot of effects rely heavily on simple postprocessing algorithms, so I figured I could at least put more effort into that.\n\n@Kali\nIf it were up to me, I'd be puting your recent \"Swirled\" shader on the front page.",

The name was just a place holder that I never bothered to change, but the example does contain a cliche refraction-reflection loop, so I'll leave it as is for now. I have some interesting bendy light examples that I'll eventually get around to posting.\n\nI definitely prefer the refraction, DOF, etc, logic contained in path tracers. I tend to make post-processing DOF blur logic up as I go. Sometimes, I might want less blur falloff near the camera and more toward the horizon, etc. What I'd really like to see is a nice compact bokeh function without needing to stitch together several tabs.

The real life objects are usually done up with lights and so forth to make some really cool imagery, and I'd like to make one of those later.\n\nIn regard to the surfaces that let light through in one direction, but not the other, I've never looked into it -- It was probably mentioned during one of my classes when I was staring out the window thinking about anything other than math and physics.  I referrred to the panels as two way mirrors.

Its even nicer.\n\nSo, I've got a draft where I've used that? Can you see drafts? I use the actual pixel size, you used a magic number 0.03 or something, I've got rid of most of the branches with clamps but anyway....\n\nThis is a nice shader. I like the brown color did you look at my toroids shader?\n\nAnyway. Its kind of ironic as I did the cards shader as a demo to get a job and you COMPLETELY rewrote it. You know when things are spinning you can get away with not antialiasing and I thought my approach drawing from the front object had its merits, I don't know how to profile the shaders.

We then generate a detail normal map from one of the provided images on Shadertoy using a high-pass filter. In a typical gamedev scenario, artists would provide these maps in textures. We then combine both normals using Reoriented Normal Mapping, as well as other commonly-used techniques. \n\nThe goal behind this little demo is to demonstrate that several well-accepted techniques by the art community are actually quite wrong, and should not be used. This is especially true for the well-known Overlay approach or \"just add them and normalize, I tell you it works\" approaches to combining normal maps that you can find on several art forums. Hopefully one day the old approaches will be forgotten, and all those faulty normal map blending tutorials one can find on the Internet will vanish. ;)\n\nReoriented Normal Mapping (RNM) involves rotating (or reorienting) the detail normal map so that it follows the \"surface\" of the base normal map, just as tangent-space normals are transformed by the underlying geometry when lighting in object or world space. We chose quaternions because they allow to easily represent the unique rotation from one vector to another (here, between the reference normal [0,0,1] and the base normal), via the shortest arc. Once this quaternion is defined, we can easily transform the detail normal and get the resulting (reoriented) normal. \n\nPlease check out our paper if you want to see how the quaternion math was simplified (here: http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/blending-in-detail/)",

This one marches through cell IDs instead of physical space - it finds intersections from the ray origin each time instead of accumulating cell positions as a moving cursors (if I understand well) - so that could bring extra stability for long rays perhaps? Also this one precomputes the dot products of the ray direction and the face normals, since those are constant during all the traversal (and their inverse, so only a mul is needed per iteration).\n\nBut conceptually both implementations they seem to work on the same principle, not surprisingly, this is just how one traverses square grids as well: 4dSGW1.

Well, in this case I'm rendering the actual hexagonal prisms, but the idea is to use the exact hexagon traversal as a general acceleration structure, and then raymarch trees/rocks/whatever inside each cell. Similar to this shader where I to grid traversal and raymarching inside each cell. Hexagons are a better way to evenly partition space than squares (closer to a circle). I remember when I studied cell phone networks at uni we used hex cells for this reason. Also Uber and other map-dependent services use hexagon tiling to index their data.",

You do simple lighting better than anyone else, that's for sure. \n\nI've tried both both approaches (cell by cell and sphere tracing) for rendering 3D planes of hexagonal grids, and each have their merits. I like the preciseness of the cell by cell, but I tend to go with the versatile 4-tap sphere traced version, since it allows for soft shadows, easy distance field modifications, etc. I've never specifically benchmarked the two methods side by side, but this demonstration runs in fullscreen on my laptop with ease. The 4-tap (or 3-tap simplex) version requires more cell visits, but can leap several cells at time, and requires fewer operations than you'd initially think.",

        "P_Malin, 2019-09-19Thanks alro.\nWhen I say \"clipping\", I just mean that any color values output to the final screen buffer will get \"clipped\" when they are greater than one. Color values greater than one don't make sense for this kind of color space for output to a monitor so in the GPU hardware it is like there is a final piece of shader code that says:\nif ( fragColor.r > 1.0f ) fragColor.r = 1.0f;\nif ( fragColor.g > 1.0f ) fragColor.g = 1.0f;\nif ( fragColor.b > 1.0f ) fragColor.b = 1.0f;\nThis can have a number of different terms like, clamping, clipping, or saturating.\nIn HLSL the instruction saturate (which is often free) limits values to be between 0.0f and 1.0f inclusive.\n\nClipping generally is about keeping sections of an input that lie within a particular region (like clipping a line or polygon primitive to just keep the region that is onscreen). Here I'm using the term to describe color clipping - keeping the range of color values that are valid to send to the display.\n\nThe clipping that was happening when a color reached 1.0 was making a sudden jump or discontinuity when there was a transition from a smoothly increasing gradient to a constant value. The code change I added makes it so that the initial slope for dark values near zero is the same as it was previously but then as values get bigger they taper off so bigger and bigger numbers all the way up to infinity get squashed into a smaller range and the output never quite reaches one.",

        "P_Malin, 2019-09-12Hi Alro,\nApologies if you don't want feedback \n\nIts a stylistic thing but currently you clip the individual r,g,b color values. This produces the \"rings\" in the image as the red channel will clamp first, then green, then blue and these discontinuities in the gradient are visible. \nIts a complicated topic but one option here when you have input values > 1.0 is to apply a tonemap function with a shoulder so that these dont 'clip' when they reach 1.0.\n\ne.g. you can add this line, in this case perhaps just before the final fragColor = line in your shader:\ncol = 1.0 - exp( -col );\n\nI made a graph to illustrate: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f14x5a9lsb\n\nThis has a similar effect to remove the clipping in your \"GLOWING WAVES\" shader too.\n\nI think the glow looks cool without this change by the way, I'm just throwing the idea out there.",

The trick is to get stuck right in and do something, anything, because thinking about it (or procrastinating) is just not good enough!!!  I started off tinkering with other people's shaders just to find out what they were doing - like reducing loops and changing what I thought were colours etc. Also, Inigo has a very good site for resources (despite the typos  )\nhttp://www.iquilezles.org/",

So let's talk about it:\n\n    Fractal geometry: Everybody says we have a lot of fractals going on here, and it's tremendous, isn't it? The author is clearly very smart, probably as smart as me, using all these methods and doing all this wonderful work. We should have more of this, I always say!\n    Noise and hash functions: This is about creating something totally unique, just like when we did it with the economy - there's nobody does noise functions better, nobody. We have the top people working on this, top!\n    Blurring effects: You see this blur? It's soft, it's subtle - it's all about the details. When you're as successful as me, you understand that the small details make a big, big difference.\n    Color Correction: We've got the best color correction. The ACES Filmic Tone Mapping is a winner, just like us. We're going to make colors great again!\n    Performance considerations: And this, this is about winning. It's about performance, just like we always perform. They've got the best loop limits, and we're seeing amazing things happening.\n\nThis is a fantastic shader. It's very complex, just like running a country, and I've done both. Maybe a little cleanup here and there, but it's pretty good. Like always, the key is to hire the best people, and we've got them. Fantastic job!",

        "MinimilisticBits, 2023-06-13To ath500\nI'm glad to see that my code has been analyzed and appreciated for its advanced techniques in GLSL. Developing this shader was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on the insights provided.\n\n    Fractal geometry: Yes, fractal generation is a key focus of my code. I'm deeply fascinated by the intricate patterns and structures that can be created through iterative algorithms. I wanted to explore various types of fractals and experiment with different techniques to achieve visually captivating results. It's great to see that the complexity and diversity of my fractal generation methods have been acknowledged.\n\n    Noise and hash functions: I integrated a hash function and a random noise generator to introduce randomness into the fractal generation process. These functions are indeed widely used in procedural generation and were crucial for adding complexity and variability to the generated fractals. They help create a more organic and natural appearance in the final output.\n\n    Blurring effects: Implementing blurring effects was essential to enhance the visual quality of the shader. By applying convolution operations and sampling neighboring pixels, I aimed to achieve smooth transitions and soften the details in the image. This technique allowed me to create a more aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing result.\n\n    Color Correction: I'm glad that the use of the ACES Filmic Tone Mapping curve for color correction was recognized. I wanted to achieve a more realistic and cinematic color reproduction, and this technique was instrumental in achieving that goal. The curve parameters were carefully selected to produce the desired aesthetic, and they can be tweaked to adapt to different use cases or artistic preferences.\n\n    Performance considerations: Indeed, real-time rendering performance was a significant factor in designing the code. By utilizing loops with a constant number of iterations, I ensured that the time complexity remained low and the shader could render efficiently. However, I am aware that as the complexity of the fractals or scenes increases, there is a possibility of visual artifacts or incomplete renderings. In future iterations, I will explore dynamic loop limits to address these potential issues and enhance the rendering capabilities.\n\nI appreciate the feedback regarding code organization and clarity. While I aimed to create a visually stunning shader, I understand the importance of making the code more understandable for others. Your suggestions for increased commentary, including explanations of the mathematical principles, descriptions of function purposes, and clear identification of experimental sections, are valuable. I will definitely consider these improvements to make the code more accessible and easier to comprehend.\n\nThank you for taking the time to analyze my code and provide such insightful feedback. It's encouraging to know that my efforts in leveraging GLSL and mathematical principles in computer graphics have been recognized. I'll continue to refine my skills and explore new possibilities in shader development.",

        "ath500, 2023-06-08It's clear that the author of this code is using a combination of advanced techniques in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which includes procedural noise generation, blurring, and color correction, to produce some visually interesting results. Here are some insights that can be drawn from the provided code:\n\n1. **Fractal geometry:** A significant part of the code is dedicated to fractal generation, specifically 3D fractals. The methods `jb`, `jb2`, `jb3`, `DEmine`, `de22`, `DEeerr`, `newde`, `fractal`, `fractal_de46` and a few others generate fractal-based distance estimations using a variety of iterative techniques. It's also noteworthy that the author is experimenting with various fractal types and techniques.\n\n2. **Noise and hash functions:** The author uses a hash function `wang_hash` and a random noise generator `rndf` in the fractal generation process, which are commonly used in procedural generation for producing randomness.\n\n3. **Blurring effects:** The `blur` and `blur2` functions implement a sort of convolution operation to produce a blur effect, sampling surrounding pixels and applying weights to them. It's an effective technique to create smooth transitions and soften the details in the image.\n\n4. **Color Correction:** The `ACESFilm` function appears to implement a color correction using the ACES Filmic Tone Mapping curve. This technique is often used in games and films to achieve a more realistic or cinematic color reproduction. It's important to mention that the curve parameters (a, b, c, d, and e) are typically chosen to produce the desired aesthetic and may be tweaked to fit the specific use-case.\n\n5. **Performance considerations:** The loops in fractal calculation functions have a constant number of iterations, which means the time complexity is O(1). This helps to ensure real-time rendering performance. However, as the complexity of the fractal or scene increases, these hard-coded loop limits could lead to visual artifacts or incomplete renderings.\n\nOverall, this is a quite advanced shader demonstrating solid knowledge of both GLSL and the underlying mathematical principles used in computer graphics. Despite the complexity, the code could benefit from some refactoring and increased commentary for better understandability. The commenting could include explanations of the mathematical principles in use, descriptions of each function's purpose, and clearer identification of experimental or 'work-in-progress' sections of code.",

That's feel far from your claim \"All of them seem to be his\".\n\nIf you look all the way to 8 years back, a lot of shaders were mine and of a small group of users since the community was way smaller then and the random Shader picker had more chances to pick up one of ours, naturally.\n\nI guess what is misleading you is the fact that the \"Shader of the Week\" is not \"Shader of this Week\", meaning, it's not the best shader of the current week. Instead, \"Shader of the Week\" is a shader (selected from Shadertoy's history - 8 years at the moment) that represents the website for a whole week. Basically, having had the most impressive shader on a given week doesn't mean you get priority over the other hundreds of shaders.",

It's pretty hard to see the difference on Gargantua, but if you head over to https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtKfRV (which took the same bloom algorithm) there are block-like artifacts that can be very apparent.

Sometimes it stretches even more, and gets buggy, but that's rare enough. Take a square in the 2D texture, say 64x64. Find the 3D position of a texel in the middle of it to place the bounding sphere. The radius has to be big enough to cover the maximum length the patch of cloth can extend. That is sqrt(1^2+1^2) * 64 / 2.0 * maxstretch. If the ray misses this sphere, you can skip the whole 2D rectangle. The hiararchy must be implemented without any form of recursion to make it compilable, but it simulates a recursive quad tree.",

You are approximating each vertex by a disk/sphere (and oversampling it 8x to make them small enough that they become subpixel size). You have all the vertices in a 2D texture, and you are traversing it in 2D to find ray-sphere intersections. You start from texel 0,0, then move overt it finding intersections with spheres of of bigger and smaller radius based on the level in the hierarchy, but I don't see how these spheres bound more vertices. Basically, I'm missing the 2D to 3D relationship. Any explanation would be great!!",

I think the best way to understand this would be to ignore the whole thing, then create a black and white 2D shader with an inner ring and an outer ring separated by spokes.\n\nI said, \"Comment this out...,\" when I should have said, \"Change this to 'p = abs(p)...'.\" Anyone who's ever read a text book at school knows that authors make a lot of typos, conceptual errors, etc.",

I am not a savant who knows a matrices rotation by looking at it!\nany rotation in 3d comes down to AxisAngle, you translate points around an axis by an angle (in radians)\nAn axisAngle rotation is a vec4\nit translates to a mat3 rotation matrix (and back).\nAs usual, multiplying 2 rotation matrices returns a rotation matrix that is identical to applying the 2 matrices in the same order.\nthis is non-commutative, order matters just as it does when you divide.\n---\na camera() function can be defined by 3 point parameters:  position, target, up-direction.\nmost simple (shadertoy) camera functions use these parameters (and fragment.xy), \nbecause they are intuitive and simple functions to return RayDirection (and RayPosition).\n\nThat RayDirection is then multiplied|rotated by the rotation matrix that you get from the methods below:\n---\ninterruption:\nThere are other \"camera()\" functions that take (position and an AxisAngle rotation (and fragment.xy)) as parameters to orient the camera to rotate a camera by an angle around an axis.\nbut these are less intuitive, less modifiable, more elegant, and require more knowledge about rotations in 3d.\nsuch functions directly take your rotation as axisAngle. their internal rotation basically adds one more rotation to the cameras orientation, set by fragment.xy\nyou may notice that you can build such a camera() function by understanding \"matrix rotation solution\"\n---\nto get a rotation (composed of a sum of rotations) to rotate a point by it....:\n\nmatrix rotation solution (better|easier for summing <4 rotations)\n- 1st: convert AxisAngle rotation to mat3 rotation matrix\n- 2nd: matrix multiplications to merge rotations\n- 3rd: multiply vector with merged rotation matrix to translate a point to its rotated point\n\nquaternion rotation solution (better for summing >3 rotations)\n- 1st: \"Converting the AxisAngle rotation into a quaternion\"\n- 2nd: quaternion multiplications (the quaternion equivalent to matrix multiplication)\n   ... quaternion multiplication is only half as complex as matrix multiplication\n- 3rd: apply quaternion to translate a point to its rotated position: \n   ... converting the quaternion to a rotation matrix should be fastest on GPUs. \n   ... but there are 2 different approaches without matrices.\n   ... It basically adds a bit of complexity that the \"matrix rotation solution\" does not have.\n---- \nwhy quaternions:\nmax3*mat3 multiplication is 9* dot().\nquaternion*quaternion is almost only half as many multiplications and additions and functionally identical, just represented differently.\nbeware tat quaternions, by storing the same rotations with less values, more quickly accumulate rounding errors.\n\nfor newer GPUS not using quaternions can easily calculate just as fast as not using them.\nbut using quaternions in long kinematic chains is definitely less computationally complex, likely saving energy, likely keeping a gui cooler.\n\nyour shadertoy code likely does not need quaternion functions, because it rarely sums more than 3 rotations,where matrix is faster and more precise.\nbut if you do add more than 3 rotations, the quaternion code below is likely faster:\n//of course it is also bulkier in source code than just multiplying matrices.\n----------------------------------\n//quaternion functions are untested and could contains typos:\n\n//return quaternion of normalized(!) axisAngle: a.xyz=axis a.w=angle\nvec4 aaToQuat(vec4 a){return vec4(a.xyz*sin(a.w*.5),cos(a.w*.5));}\n  \n//return quaternion of axisAngle (after normalizing Axis): a.xyz=axis a.w=angle\nvec4 aaToQuatN(vec4 a){return aaToQuat(vec3(a.xyz/length(a.xyz),a.w));}\n \n//quaternion normalize\nvec4 quatNorm(vec4 q){return q/length(q);}\n//quaternion multiplications tend to lose accuracy, you chose how often you normalize them.\n//normalizing of course adds rounding errors.\n\n//get conjugate quaternion\nvec4 conjugate(Quat4d q){vec4 r=q; r.xyz=-q.xyz;return r;}\n\n//transform|rotate point p by quaternion q, \"like\" an axis angle rotation with axis trough (0,0)\nvec3 QuatTrans(vec3 p,vec4 q){float x=q.x;float y=q.y; float z=q.z; float w=q.w;//shortcuts\n //return vec3(\n //   w*w*p.x+2.*y*w*p.z-2*z*w*p.y+   x*x*p.x+2.*y*x*p.y+2.*z*x*p.z-   z*z*p.x-y*y*p.x,\n //2.*x*y*p.x+   y*y*p.y+2*z*y*p.z+2.*w*z*p.x-   z*z*p.y+   w*w*p.y-2.*x*w*p.z-x*x*p.y,\n //2.*x*z*p.x+2.*y*z*p.y+  z*z*p.z-2.*w*y*p.x-   y*y*p.z+2.*w*x*p.y-   x*x*p.z+w*w*p.z);\n //above function likely performs slower on GPUs than below function:\n return p1*QuatToMat3(q);}\n\n//a (likely faster on gpu) method is to transform the quaternion to its matrix form:\n\n//return mat3 transformation matrix of quaternion q, \"like\" an axis angle rotation with axis trough (0,0)\nmat3 QuatToMat3(vec4 q){return mat3(vec3 s=q.xyz*w.xyz*2.;\n vec3 x=2.*vec3(q.x*q.y,q.x*q.z,q.x*q.w);vec3 w=2.*vec3(q.y*q.z,q.y*q.w,q.z*q.w);\n //i am not too sure if buffering all these values in 2 vec3 makes it faster.\n return mat3(1.-s.y-s.z,   x.x-w.z,x.y+w.y,\n                x.x+w.z,1.-s.x-s.z,w.x-x.z,\n                x.y-w.y,   w.x+x,z,1.-s.x-s.y);}\n//there are different approaches to this identity:\n//see http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/conversions/quaternionToMatrix/index.htm\n\nfloat maf(float a,float b, float c){return fmad(a,b,c);//less percision, more speed\n//return mad(a,b,c);//explicit mad(), because we do not trust the compiler to be smart!\nreturn a*b+c;}//let it be implicit, but with explicit order!\n//explicit \"mad()\" or fmad()\n\n//quaternion multiplication is not commutative\nquatMul(vec4 q1,vec4 q2){return vec4(\n maf(q1.x,q2.w,(q1.y*q2.z))-maf(q1.z,q2.y,(q1.w*q2.x)),\n maf(q1.y,q2.w,(q1.z*q2.x))-maf(q1.x,q2.z,(q1.w*q2.y)),\n maf(q1.x,q2.y,(q1.z*q2.w))-maf(q1.y,q2.x,(q1.w*q2.z)),\n -q1.x*q2.x-q1.y*q2.y      -maf(q1.z,q2.z,(q1.w*q2.w)));\n //above should be identical to code below:\n // q1.x*q2.w+q1.y*q2.z-q1.z*q2.y+q1.w*q2.x,\n //-q1.x*q2.z+q1.y*q2.w+q1.z*q2.x+q1.w*q2.y,\n // q1.x*q2.y-q1.y*q2.x+q1.z*q2.w+q1.w*q2.z,\n //-q1.x*q2.x-q1.y*q2.y-q1.z*q2.z+q1.w*q2.w)\n ;}//product of 2 quaternion rotations is identical of 2 rotations being executed one after another.\n//this often accumulates rounding errors to a point were you need to normalize the quaternion a lot!\n---\nexerpt:\n\"second life\" uses quaternions for anything. it doesn't have a vec4 type, it just has vec3 and \"quaternion\", force feeding you quaternion rotation and converting Euler- to quaternion-rotation.\n\"second life\" wikis and open-source scripts have some interesting solutions for quaternion questions\nsuch as \"why the hell does this plane rotate completely randomly\"",

Do you have any paper or book to advise to implement the physics of resting convex objects (at least cubes  ??. I already read the Eberly and the Millington books (I mean I REALLY read them) and wrote a lot of code, but I got stuck on the problem of the resting objects. The Millington lacks of explanations of the algorithm while the Eberly model it as a Quadratic Programming problem that is difficult to implements. Moreover, the Eberly only consider the object linear motion in collision detection and that simply does not work in my opinion (for sure I'm wrong, but I can see why).

It would have been nice to work in some extra desert-related scenery, but the framerate was an issue.\n\n@stb\nMy girlfriend walked past my screen and said it was too grainy as well. You two would probably get along. \n\nSeriously, offline, I load up WebGL textures with the anisotropic filter setting, which produces finer detail at grazing angles, minus the speckling. On Shadertoy, I've never been able to emulate the same. If you click on the iChannel1 (sandstone texture) \"cog\" icon, then change the \"Filter\" setting to \"mipmap,\" you'll get rid of the terrain speckling, but the surface will look kind of plastic. Alternatively, you could change the bump strength in the \"doBumpMap\" function, but that will smoothen things out too... I'll bet there's a way to have detail and smoothness.

You can also use a 2D sdBezier() there for extra rendering performance, but little compile time difference unfortunately.\n\nThen I could also reduce the compile time further from 9 to 5 seconds by changing the subsurface computation by this, which looks almost the same imho and doesn't invoke the SDF: float sss = ss*0.2*clamp(0.5+0.5*dot(ld,nor),0.0,1.0)*(2.0+dot(rd,nor));\nAnd finally, the next compile-time eater is the cloth bump mapping. If I remove it (which doesn't change the look much I think?), the compile time then goes down to 3 seconds for me.\n\nAt 3 seconds compile time, which is sub 5s, the shader qualifies for Shader of the Week (the reason I explored options), but obviously needs the small changes of visuals",

The kernel is a 2D function or small matrix containing the coefficients applying to each neighborhood pixels. A Gaussian(x,y) is a very good filter (better that all coefficient = 1, which is the box filter), and it has the nice property than  Gaussian(x,y)=  Gaussian(sqrt(x\u00b2+y\u00b2)) = Gaussian(x)*Gaussian(y), so you can just filter the x values with a 1xN filter, store the result, then apply a Nx1 filter along the y.\n\nMIPmap is how textures in graphics and especially in OpenGL can allow very cheap antialiasing: the texture are already precomputed are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 .... resolution, each obtain by averaging 4 neighbor pixels. By default the \"mipmap\" flag is set in texture pannel, so that when you zoom out the texture it is automatically blurred (not-perfect, but almost free). Since this data is there, smart algorithms can take advantage to mix thin and coarse texture pixels to compute the sum.\nYou can explicitely access this data using  textureLod() instead of texture(), with extra parameter = LOD level.",

This can even take into account Gaussian profile.\n- use MIPmap (3rd texture() parameter).\n\nFrom there, you might add optimizations ;-)\nYour approach just ignore many pixels, which could cause aliasing, and there is no kernel decreasing with distance. \nFor instance you could increase the MIPmap level as you go out of center (+ decrease weight), in order to keep a hole-free coverage.",

Relatively speaking, it's a pretty short example, so making changes shouldn't be too much of a task. I usually find the most draining chore is object identification without sacrificing speed, but I'm going to start formalizing the process to make it easier.\n\n@ExNihilo\nI sometimes weave a camera in and out of grid structures. Even with a simple sinusoidal curve, it's possible to weave around as many as four columns and keep the flow whilst maintaining camera speed. I decided against it here. Not sure why.

If you have a camera with a fixed shutter at 24Hz, then that's your framerate, and your motion blur should also calculate in 24Hz. But in realtime graphics, depending on a lower or higher framerate, the motion between frames can either be shorter or longer, so the effect needs to take framerate into account.

This kernel can be calculated by applying the Jacobi solver iteration to a delta impulse (basically one white pixel on a black background). Using the previous pressure solution as an initial guess for the Jacobi pressure solver greatly enhances the solution quality in this case. The Jacobi method iteration is applying a diffusion step to the initial guess in each iteration, yielding a normal distribution as a convolution kernel. All these lines of code are just applying these two convolutions to the right-hand side of the Poisson equation and to the previous pressure solution respectively. One could probably speed things up a bit by using the separability of the Gaussian convolution of the previous pressure solution. Sidenote: Applying advection to the previous pressure solution would increase the quality of the simulation even further.",

It makes my head hurt just thinking about the amount of effort that must have gone into it. Just writing a simplistic WebGL back-end is an exercise in frustration. I remember spending far too long putting some routines together just to load multiple textures.",

Would you be willing to implement it there as a regular frag/vertex shader? Entirely up to you, of course.",

I wanted to associate it with Voronoi, but not give the impression that it was worthy of a Voronoi replacement. Most of the hard work was done by Ken Perlin, and the geometrical aspects were probably based on the work of some mathematician before him. Either way, I'm thankful that I didn't have to start from scratch.\n\n@Nimitz\n\nLike you inferred, once you have four tetrahedral (8 cubic, etc) vertices and some kind of randomization (gradient vectors work better), you could probably do all kinds of experimentation. You can get pretty close to simplex noise by changing just a couple of things in the code above. It'd be great to see what people come up with. I know of a way to make more natural looking rocky patterns with a couple of changes.\n\nAn 8-vertex, cubic version was part of the process, but I found it involved more calculation... although, it's possible that you have a faster way of going about it than I did. I'd imagine that a surrounding tetrahedral-neighbors random-offset distance approach would give nicer patterns, but then all the speed benefits would disappear. I may have already tried it, but can't remember. I do remember making a 3-tap 2D version, just for the fun of it.\n\nI had the same thought with respect to parallax mapping. With particular geometric objects, my mind never quite accepts that a bumped surface is a raised surface.",

Also, other metrics could be used within that grid (may it be simplex or cubic) to create interesting 3d textures I bet.\n\nAlso, if eiffie is reading, might be interesting to use that skewed simplex grid for your \"Tetrahedronator\" (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llf3z8)",

I've come close using an amalgamation of sine and triangle noise, but it doesn't have the same feel.\n\nI've tested the fake Voronoi function out on a few 3D beveled Voronoi shaders here, and it definitely improves frame rate.

It is running at 144fps for me. If I calculated right, thats something like 70% left after a minute, which does seem to fit my observation.

The thing is I tried everything in your Paint Streams and succeded in a collision rule that enclosed everything and seemed to work (no mass was getting to the rim because I also added a force to send it back out of the collision object) but the fluid still kept disappearing over time. This could be a case of 3), or it is 2) and the amount of mass that escapes through the collision object is just too small to see with the shading I used - or - the mass got stuck right on the surface of the collision object (sucked in like a black hole xD). \n\nSo I am pretty sure that 1) and 3) are a thing, but 2) I think can be avoided with the right collision handling.",

I don't know how others do it.\n\nAnyway, I reasoned to myself a while ago that it'd be impossible to achieve thick equi width isolines on nonlinear functions like this without resorting to more sophisticated methods - like pointilizing the isolines and running Bezier lines through them... Of course, I may be incorrect, in which case, I'd love to see an example.\n\nHowever, with thinner lines, you can at least fake it. How, depends on what you're after. I've used \"x*(1 - x)\"  for smoothing combined with the cheap GPU Minkowski (?) distance \"fwidth.\" I forgot about the simplest case \"1 - x,\" but that'd work too, and might even be better, so I might experiment with it. Commented out is the \"x*x*(3 - 2*x)\" case. Swapping \"fwdith\" for a software Euclidean distance looks even better, but isn't as cheap. I'm currently doing a bumped Voronoi example that tries to use better methods.",

It all depends on the sample spread you're interested in.\n\nIf you were trying to take readings that spanned more than a pixel, then I guess you'd have to take readings for the function itself a couple of times and perform \"fwidth\" by hand. Even so, it'd still be cheaper than supersampling. Having said that, if framerate wasn't a factor, I'd prefer supersampling.\n\n@shau\nVia online pictures, I think I know the particular piece you're referring to. It'd be reasonably easy to make a 3D version. However making something cheap with pixel-precise, frame-shot-quality antialising might prove difficult. I've never really figured out a way to perform cheap 3D antialiasing. You can edge-detect a scene in a buffer, then only supersample the pixels that need doing, but I don't quite find that fast enough yet.

This is correct since energy is radiated out along the z-axis in addition to within the plane of the visualization.\nLocal average energy would be constant inside a 3d spherical arrangement of sources (no magical disappearance of energy inside this structure, assuming it is filled with free space / lossless propagation medium).",

        "Diapsid, 2020-12-20This concept is used by MIMO antenna arrays like in cell phone towers to direct beams away from interference and towards specific targets. Audio and electromagnetic waves are similar enough that the array theory should work for both. I actually just wrote my first shader program using a circular array, but uniformly spaced with no phase difference between them. I treated each as the origin of a 2D cosine function and added the value of the offset cosines together at each pixel in a for loop. There's a method called the Schelkunoff spaced-zeroes method that takes a linear array and chooses specific amplitudes for each element to direct nulls in specified directions. I might code that up soon in ShaderToy, I've done it Processing and Matlab already for a university course.\n\nI think this method is the one you're thinking of, or at least very similar. Using it on a very large linear array can create arbitrarily large directivity, to the point where energy only radiates in <1\u00b0 beamdwidths in any specified direction, so you could choose a person out of a lineup to hear the sound with no one else being able to. The tradeoff is that it is extremely inefficient, and in antennas instead of radiating away most of the energy, it gets stored in the reactive near-field, which is drastically affected by any object in that area. So you can have 100 antennas broadcasting the signal, but the received signal level may be 1/10000th the magnitude of the transmitted energy. As you let the beam get broader, you gain back your efficiency.",

So if you put a black object in the vicinity of a white \"point light\" you don't actually get shadows, instead, the light is consumed by the black light in the vicinity of the black object. You do not get occlusion because everything emits \"light\" in a way.",

On a side note, I have a half finished water refraction example that I completely forgot about. \n\n@akohdr\nThere are things GPUs like, and others they struggle with. I'm sure everyone's had experience with that; Grouping operations in vectors, avoiding nesting, etc. However, I find plain old logic goes a long way. For instance, functions at the end of the line that get called the most need the most attention. In many circumstances, that means the distance function, which in turn means trying to provide one that's easy calculate and to hone in on.\n\nLayering in order of aesthetic importance helps also. As an example, a lot of people will raymarch several layers of noise. However, raymarching the lower frequency, larger amplitudes and bump mapping the finer details can give a similar aesthetic, but at double the framerate. Replacing the larger amplitudes with sinusoidals can be even faster.\n\nIn regards to the actual voxel traversal algorithm, you'll see that the \"map\" function isn't being converted to the voxelized form, nor is there any boolean logic, so that saves some calls... I think. Little things like that help. Going off on a slight tangent, I've often wondered whether some kind of hybrid sphere-tracing\\voxel-traversal could improve things by increasing step distance... but others haven't tried, so perhaps I'm overlooking something.",

Generally speaking, that's not enough to produce a realistic flythrough (clouds from a distance is possible though), so I opted for a kind of artsy style that got the point across, but it's in no way supposed to represent realism. \n\nProducing realistic clouds isn't the problem; it's trying to do so with as few steps and taps as possible. Computers are pretty fast these days, but there'd be plenty of systems that couldn't run this shader efficiently in its current state, let alone a more GPU intensive one. I have a couple of ideas that I'm going to try out that I think might produce more feature rich clouds, but even then, I'd imagine it'd only be feasible to run on moderately good systems.",

They might work... or they might not.  \n\n@Fabrice\nThanks for the link. Hopefully, with that and a few other shaders on here, I might be able to cobble something together. \n\n@Dave_Hoskins\nI threw the time component in at the end to provide a bit of animation. I didn't give it too much thought beyond that. Anyway, I toned down the figures and gave it more of a windswept right to left feel. Not sure it it helped, but this shader was just a test run anyway.\n\n@Kuvkar\nI used the 2D texture for backwards compatibility.

We did that in http://evasion.imag.fr/Publications/2008/BNMBC08/. Maybe you might grab some of the principle to fake something less accurate but still grasping some of the effect. The idea is to separate pack of rays by there number of scattering in the cloud. Low number are only backreflected locally. But the larger the order the deeper they go, seen the clouds blurrier with order scale. The trick is to be able do that backward, from the out point (that is the cloud pixel you see :-) )",

I also mentioned that the high cloud density was a style choice. Basically, the clouds are supposed to look a little cartoony. I could change a few things here and there to make it look more conventionally realistic, but I still don't think it would quite right. This particular example uses just 64 steps and two distance field lookups at each one. It's not that much to work with - Just a bit of diffuse and shading. \n\nPutting together a geneuinely realistic looking cloud flythrough would require a fair bit of creativity, since you'd have to provide the illusion of volumetric light and shadows without the huge cost. I'll probably attempt it anyway... or I might save myself the trouble and wait for someone else on here to do it. That's worked well for me in the past. \n\n@aiekick\nGod rays would be great, and they're easy to implement - Just light everything volumetrically. Unfortunately, doing that for every step would be crazy expensive. Having said that, I'd still like to see if it could be done. A strategically-placed full screen radial blur might be a very cheap alternative, but it wouldn't look anywhere near as good.",

The specular lighting is applied independently of surface color (globally, I guess) to make things look shinier, and with a lower specular power to make it more prominent. Other things that effect the overall look are light placement, gamma correction (that's imperative), etc. A lot of the times, it comes down to tweaking the figures until you produce something you're happy with.\n\nThis would have a more gelatinous-like consistency if I were to take out the rigidity. To make it look wetter, I'd probably increase the specular power to something like 64, and multiply it by 3, or something to that effect. Applying some fake diffraction would help too.",

The first thing I want to try, is to make several low res depth only passes before tracing the main image. Let's say make 3 steps on 16x9 texture, then 10 steps on 480x270, then full res image. Low res passes should stop when distance is lower than pixel size, so next pass can sample depth of previous and continue tracing. Could be done on shadertoy actually.\n\nConstructing base model with marching cubes? Giving the vast range of detail sizes, and the fact that overlaping parts of the mesh will be rasterized several times, this solution doesn't appeal to me. (Also I can't into C++) But I was thinking about generating the mesh in screen space(with geometry shader maybe) that will somehow place more vertexes, where there are edges and thin details.

        "maxwellcoffee, 2023-05-24\n\nSuper Sampling: The code uses a technique called super sampling to improve image quality. It achieves this by sampling multiple points within each pixel and then averaging the results to get the final color. This reduces aliasing and produces a smoother image.\n\nTime and Space Deformation: The code uses time and space to create animation and variation in the image. Time is used to animate and change the image over time, while spatial deformation creates interesting visual effects.\n\nDepth of Field: The code uses a simple depth of field effect to blur objects that are far from the focus point. This can give a sense of depth and perspective to the image.\n\nTexture Sampling: The shader samples from a texture to generate color and detail in the image. You can use a variety of textures to create different visual effects.\n\nCylindrical Deformation: The shader deforms the image to create a cylindrical shape. This is a key part of the visual effect created by the shader.\n\nLayering: The shader uses layering to create a sense of depth and complexity in the image. Each layer is rendered separately and then combined to create the final image.\n\nShading/Coloring: The shader uses a combination of different techniques to color the image. This includes things like diffuse shading, texture blending, and color correction.\n\nNon-Uniform Scaling: The shader applies non-uniform scaling to the textures to create an interesting warping effect.\n\nSinusoidal Oscillations: The shader uses sinusoidal functions to create oscillating effects. This could be used to create things like waves or other periodic patterns in the image.\n\nExponential Decay: The shader uses an exponential decay function to reduce the intensity of colors as they move further away from the center. This can give a sense of depth and focus to the image.\n\n[Generated with GPT-4]",

And the color of the texture there, or at least the first component of it, is the strength of the sound at that frequency? Is there a spec about this somewhere?\n\nSimilarly, in the wave data (second row), the x (or u) axis of the texture is the X axis of the waveform over this tiny slice of time (scaled to the 0-to-1 interval).

I think I wrote it one night and at the time I had a laptop with an integrated intel GPU so that was actually my target \nThere are a couple of things that make this fast. Firstly, the number of raymarch steps is very low ( kRaymarchIterations 24 ). Secondly, the shading is very simple; There is just a cubemap reflection with some additive light / glow from the orbit trap. As there are no real reflections there is only one raymarch per-pixel. Also, this is a single buffer shader so there is no floating point intermediate buffer getting written to and read from.",

Valve's dithering is also oddly delicate only adding roughly +/-0.2 to the value 0-255 color value. For best results from dithering you really want to do a +1.5 to -0.5 noise range.

I once was making a little hobby project of a real time raytraced FPS where axis aligned boxes defined rooms, that could have portals on the wall that led to other AA boxes, and each box contained information about it's contents.  It worked ok, but there was no magic there and it wouldn't have scaled well.  You can see a video of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARjAtkwaS0.\n\nRight now I'm starting a hybrid rasterization / ray tracing / ray marching game project inspired by marble madness that I intend to finish and ship.\n\nMy plan here is to do some rasterization of polygons, but then for things which are ray traced or ray marched, i'll draw a scaled / oriented cube that contains them, and do the ray based work in the pixel shader.\n\nThe goal is to have those ray rendered objects be representable as minimally as possible so that every object will have access to every other object to allow reflection and refraction against these objects.\n\nI'd also like for them to have access to the rasterized rendering so that they can use that information for screen space glossy reflections, maybe falling back to reflection probes when that information isnt available..\n\nIt would also be nice, when doing the rasterization pass, to have access to the ray based objects, so that the rasterized geometry could also get reflections and maybe refractions?\n\nLastly, I might try to have things just have a limited number of reflection (and refraction?) bounces, and use temporal anti aliasing to try and harvest the information from the last frame as much as possible, so that (like in Killzone) each frame you render gives you another ray bounce.\n\nIt seems like it would be interesting when limiting ray bounces to try a monte carlo approach where you randomly choose which ray to take based on say, the fresnel reflection vs refraction multiplier.\n\nI have one more shadertoy I want to make (I want to try for glitter / metal flake style surfaces), but after that am starting in on the project.\n\nWho knows how it will actually turn out and whether these ideas will be practical when the rubber hits the road, or get me the results I want.

I like to get other people's take on things.\n\nI know it's possible to emulate recursive raytracing in a pixel shader using a stack, but speed is still an issue, especially when rendering anything interesting. I've experimented by hand coding the first reflective and refractive pass, then entering the multiple bounce loop (choosing the strongest ray) from there. It kind of looks OK, and speed is OK with just three or four extra bounces, but it's messy... \n\nI guess there'll come a day when random pixel access on the CPU will be faster than our best graphics cards, but then soft shadows and volumetrics will slow things down. Sadly, by the time computers are able to do what I'd like them to, I'll be too old to care. Anyway, I guess I should get back to my current minimal, abstract scene with no bounces. Sigh!",

I'd like to do a multilevel version with stairs and indoor banisters at some stage, but it might be difficult to get it running quickly.\n\n@dr2\nFrom a visual interest standpoint, this scene could do with an animated entity of some form, and automated robots would do nicely. I'd love to see your take on something like this. I'd imagine it'd be quite something.\n\n@pthextract\nI never let these run for more than a minute or so, but it wouldn't surprise me if some errors would creep in with large time values. Hardware is not my forte, but it's pretty easy to see that the GPU \"sin\" function breaks down with large values. I'll assume the lab nerds who designed the circuitry of standard GPUs needed to trade off between accuracy and speed.\n\nI guess it'd be possible determine a time point at which scene resets itself and set the time back to zero... but hoping everyone gets bored with it in under a minute is my lazy solution.",

I use them all the time for a range of different things: Foundation layers, cheap noise, etc. The combination I've used in this particular example is just a cheap way to provide extra variation, to make the surface look a little more haphazard. Explaining what combinations work for what situation would take a while, but it's easy enough to figure out after experimenting a bit.\n\nFor instance, in 2D:\nsin(p.x + p.y)\nsin(p.x)*sin(p.y)\nsin(p.x) + sin(p.y) = dot(sin(p), vec2(1))\nsin(p.x + cos(p.y)) + sin(p.y + cos(p.x)) = dot(sin(p + cos(p.yx)), vec2(1))\n// etc.\n\nYou can also combine sinusoidal layers at difference frequencies and amplitudes in the same way fBm noise is produced.",

If genuine 3D Voronoi was involved, it'd be running very slow on all computers. Even so, it'd be possible to cut back here and there to get this running faster.\n \nFor instance, dropping the distance field height, loosing the raymarching precision, cutting back on non essentials, etc... Although, I'm still not sure it'd be enough to get it running at full tilt on Android.\n\nI think the best way to give it a chance would be to change the distance field itself to something cheaper but similar.

However, if I were forced to describe ambient occlusion in a few words, it would be that it's a measure of how much ambient light is blocked due to the surrounds. In very simple terms, it's described as self shadowing.\n\nMost algorithms used on Shadertoy are very basic estimations, designed to minimize calls to the distance function. More sophisticated algorithms use the half hemisphere\\random ray setup. The algorithm above, however, involves starting at the surface, then stepping off of it in the direction of the normal checking to see if another part of the scene is nearby. In open spaces, lighter values are returned. Whereas, in corners, crevices, etc, darker values are returned. It's not perfect, but it does a pretty good job.\n\nTo confuse things, this particular scene also incorporates curvature and performs fake shadowy coloring via the tiled function itself. The curvature calculation is probably the one responsible for lightening the convex border regions.",

Ultimately, the texture feedback in Buf B is not even used in the composite Image. I put it in as one of the most simple reaction-diffusion effects just as surplus for curious hackers, and you can only see it when you take the look at the raw Gaussian pyramid or use the BlurB bypass. Now the pipeline would actually support Buf A feeding on Buf B and vice-versa when you set the input texture accordingly.

That isn't a bad thing necessarily, but I am getting older, and I've set a goal for myself to try to actually learn enough to create a raymarching shader for clouds for Unity this year if I can, which I will probably testbed on Shadertoy. In general I imagine I can probably do it, given enough time - teaching shaders like yours which have full commenting on them really help. \n\nRotating a camera within the raymarcher based on user input, mouse or axis based,  is something I definitely need to master next - do you have any advice or links on that, or any shaders where you allow the user to rotate the camera?",

Anyway, trust me, you don't need a tutor to learn how to raymarch. It's pretty easy to learn, but if you have any questions, my email address is in my profile.\n\nIn general there are just a few steps involved. I find that it's best to start with a template - usually one that involves a simple straight line camera through a repeat field of spheres or cubes, then take it from there. Once you've got the hang of the overall template usage, you can learn each of the individual components - like unit ray setup, scene traversal, lighting the hit point, etc.",

Eventually, they'd all be updating, anyway.\n\nI was under the impression, and still am, that \"v *= M\" and \"v = v*M\" do exactly the same thing, right down to the electrical distribution in the circuits, so they should either both work, or both fail... but I've been wrong before, so you never know. I could cry about it, or just make the changes. I think I'll do the latter. \n\nCheap SSS is something I can never get quite right. \"TekF\" has some interesting examples, one in particular. For cheap surface glow, normal bending gives OK results. \n\nBy the way, I could make this look a \"lot\" nicer by marching out (about 3 to 8 steps) from each particle towards the light source to accumulate some shadowing, but that's multiple times the \"map\" calls. Fast computers are OK with it, but it'd cripple the average user's machine.",

Just curious, does it affect my other shaders, or other peoples? If so, I'll make the changes to all of them, albeit begrudgingly. Damn browsers. \n\nIn regards to multipass light scattering, it's a big ask. As far as framerate goes, the multiple passes are the stumbling block.  Seriously, though, it'll be interesting to see what you come up with. I wouldn't be surprised if the look could be faked, to some extent.\n\nAt present, I'm trying to meld this technique with solid structures.

The only difference is that in the first case,\n we have a water-air interface (light coming from below), while in the second\n we have an air-water interface (light coming from above). To compute the \n reflection and refraction directions and coefficients, in the first case \n (air-water interface) you need to set n1 and n2 to the water and air\n refractive index respectively (while this ORDER IS REVERSED\n IN THE SECOND CASE).\"\n\nSo you should swap indices of refraction, not invert them. Instead of:\nif( ndotr > 0. ) {\n\tn1 = 1./1.5; n2 = 1.;\n\tn = -n;\n} else {\n\tn2 = 1./1.5; n1 = 1.;\n}\n\n\nshould be:\nif( ndotr > 0. ) {\n\tn1 = 1.0; \n\tn2 = 1.5;\n\tn = -n;\n} else {\n\tn1 = 1.5;\n\tn2 = 1.0; \n}\n\n\nThough the result seem to be visually the same.

This is luckily also where two consecutive SDF measurements refer to a surface point close to each other, meaning that triangulation result is close to perfect. Rays passing along a surface will not triangulate properly (SDF samples don't measure distance from the same point). But these rays have no banding issues either. So this trick improves the worst case banding, but doesn't help much with areas that don't have much issues to begin with.",

In our case, the SDF returns the closest distance to most probably different points. However the assumption is they are close enough that triangulation gives you a pretty good approximation to the closest point on the surface that is closest to the line we are marching on (a perpendicular distance). Given it's an improvement and it's virtually free, there's no reason not to use it compared to the traditional method.\n\nThe need for a marching step scale factor, biases or clamping, is a totally orthogonal issue to the traditional vs new proposed distance estimation of S.Aaltonen (sebbbi) - you might still want to use those tricks regardless of the underlying distance estimation method (direct or improved/triangulated), since after all we are scanning the ray line at intervals that might fail to capture the actual closest distance, which is needed to prevent light leaking.",

When doing the lighting for a single step along the ray, the probability of the ray hitting/viewing any particle/fog/medium is then (1 - stepTransmittance) and that probability drives the amount of light scattering that can happen along that step of the ray.",

The inclusion of an irrational number like PHI sufficiently exacerbates the non-determinism. \n\nI gave PHI to a ridiculous level of precision for current GPU cores. As these cores evolve, PHI can just be given with an arbitrarily higher level of precision, and hopefully Gold Noise should be able to survive indefinitely!\n\nbtw - I tried some of your suggestions, but none resulted in a better distribution without considerably more processing required.",

I call this \"pqfm=prime-quadratic-field-matrix\"\nmetallic-means are a subset of quadratic-fields, and PHI is likely a great start here. the tan() does not really help as much as a simple seesaw or triangle wave.\n\nGood efficient hashes/noises are a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register with a long period. They usually do a lot of xor in type uint.\nThey get slightly better, when they include mod(), making them an LCG = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator\nAbove 2 hashes are extremely common in arcade games.\nThey get extremely good, when you permute more than 1 of them to a PLCG = PCG = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permuted_congruential_generator\n\nif you want fast uniformity with long prime-permutation-periods, you can get great 3d noise with only modulo and some tiny lookUpTables that store costasArrays if unique-prime-lengths. This does a bit more mod and no xor, with the benefit of having much longer prime-factor-periots.\nA 32 bit pcg will have a period of (up to) 4,294,967,296, ideally by permuting 2 16 bit linear feedback shift registers, likely in the complexity of less than 6 modulo per iteration (if its not a full bit period, its likely also not uniform).\n\nmultiplying the sizes of 9 different primes (that are>9) via costas arrays gets you over a period of 1 million in the size of prime-faxctorization, likely at the cost of 9*3=27 modulo (or 9*4?) BUT every single costas array is pattern-free, which in theory makes this a much better noise AND costas noise in theory parallelizes more, and they need no iterating over them.",

Of course, if you need to do anything expensive during the accumulation stage, it's back to that annoying \"if\" statement. \n\nMost of all, I like the way you break from the loop when the surface distance is within a fractional distance of the total. I've applied that to some similar code I have, and it's improved things a lot.\n\nI got excited when I saw the evenly distributed spikes, then realized they were hardcoded. You can comment out \"n1\" to \"n3,\" by the way. Either way, it's given me an idea as to how to evenly distribute spikes on any object efficiently... maybe.\n\nFor what it's worth, I made a fiery version. I trimmed your version down a bit, changed the weighting slightly, made a couple of sacrifices to the spike shape in order to tighten up the distance equation, etc. Nothing exciting, but here it is:\n\nhttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lBXzy",

I believe OpenGL defines samples to be at the middle of the texel (or in this case screen pixel), so would it be more correct to sample the texture between the rays formed by offsets (-0.5,-0.5) to (+0.5,+0.5) in pixel space? In other words, is this implementation biased by 0.5 pixels to the upper right? Or am I misunderstanding something... (or maybe does it not matter",

There might be an opportunity to do custom mipmapping/downsampling here using that approach, though there's a significant disadvantage in needing to pipeline everything, i.e. needing to wait a frame for the result of the previous reduction step; I've done that before with Gaussian pyramids on Shadertoy (without using a cubemap) and you end up with some weird issues because the highest blur level is several frames delayed behind the lowest.",

The thing which help the most was to redistribute sprites among 3 buffers, so instead of 1 slow to compile shader I have 3 faster ones (in total). Tried to also make everything pixel perfect with the original, but some things had to be changed because of the different aspect (16:9 instead of 4:3) or because of compilation times.",

If you fly fairly close to the transparent spheres and look through them at a light you can see they have chromatic dispersion. I was just interested in getting it working. I need to take a break for a while and didn't make much to show that off  in the scene before publishing. The bokeh effect can look really good when turned up too. I'll probably branch this and make some more fun scenes sometime.\nThe light bulb was on the other side of the wall - you needed to fly through the wall to see it.

It is a solution perfectly matched to this specific problem and a fun thing to think about, but to be brutally honest I'm finding it doesnt generalise to practical scenarios extremely well, from experiments so far. It's bad for perf to do density computation, lighting computation for each sample of each ray on the fly. And holding the sampling error stationary like this is probably inferior to jittering the sampling and temporally filtering the result - the error is large and disturbing for shadow boundaries. In any case, research is in progress here, a few scenes and techniques are being explored: https://github.com/huwb/volsample . \n\nAnyway in regards to your questions.. I have a WIP presentation that i could share with you which has latest and greatest thinking - email me if you're interested, my contact details are on the github. For a tetrahedron the individual planes would be clearly visible due to camera perspective effects. A dodecahedron does a much better job. We generate geom for a bevelled dodecahedron and render it around the camera. Your intuitions about ray counts are spot on.. The bevel faces have a specific shader applied that marches the right number of rays, and the normals are stored per face, so everything is ready to go for the pixel shader. No branches or significant overhead at runtime, besides requiring additional raymarches. Only a tiny fraction of pixels require all 3 raymarches, i think around 1%. Around 18% needed two rays though.",

        "iestyn, 2017-06-27One more thought. Did you try using a branch to determine how many planes you need to trace?\n\nIn some parts of the screen you only need to consider axis-aligned planes and in other areas you only need to consider diagonal planes - it's only in regions where two planes blend together that you need to trace both at once.\n\nThe branch should be coherent in image-space so it should give you a speedup (esp if you need to blend 3 planes together for a full 3D version), assuming the single-plane trace function is significantly quicker than the 2 or 3 plane function.",

Did it look awful with fewer planes?\n\nI wonder what the minimum number of planes will be for full 3D... you could get away with 4 for a tetrahedron, but then if you need 8 planes for '2.5D' to look good I guess you'll need more for full 3D.\n\nI like the dodecahedron idea since it's platonic, but utilizing the symmetries with your truncated cube does sound simpler! What about an octahedron? Oh hmm, I guess that has the disadvantage that 4 planes meet at a point (as opposed to just 3 for a dodecahedron or truncated cube) so you'd need to march+blend more planes per pixel.",

I've wanted for a long time to do cone tracing on a procedural field in a shadertoy shader. The idea is to provide a radius with the map(vec3) > vec4 function of standard volumetric shader. Since noise in a FBM is usually between 0 and 1 we can blend it to 0.5 when the frequency is higher than the radius. Cone tracing a SDF is done the same way than a participating media, the only difference is that the alpha is binary (which allow us to trace through it way faster when it's empty, thanks to the SDF).

Your suggestion doesn't violate that, whereas the way I originally had it did (max could dip below min)... I think. That's just a guess.\n\nAnyway, I made the change, and I'll try to rewrite it in a more intuitive way later.

The idea behind this is to render a basic scene into \"Buf A,\" read it in from the \"Image\" tab, then radial blur it. Pretty straight forward stuff.\n\nFrom what I can gather from the image, the lattice structure perhaps isn't showing up, then just the background is being blurred out? Out of curiosity, if you transcribe the scene from \"Buf A\" into the \"Image\" tab, then delete \"Buf A,\" does it render as a normal scene? I'm trying to figure out which tab is causing the problems.\n\nOn another note, on my older computer, IE refuses to render a lot of the stuff on Shadertoy these days, including this (instruction count, maybe), so I've given up trying to accommodate it.",
